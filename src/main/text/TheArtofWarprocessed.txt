not write and very little indeed of what he did capt e f calthrop rfa published the first english translation in in tokyo dr giles said this translation was excessively bad and it is not merely a question of downright blunders from which none can hope to be wholly exempt omissions were frequent hard passages were willfully distorted or slurred over such offenses are less pardonable they would not be tolerated in any edition of a latin or greek classic and a similar standard of honesty ought to be insisted upon in translations from chinese in a new edition of captain calthrops translation was published in london it was an improvement â€” omissions filled up and numerous mistakes corrected â€” but new errors were created in the process dr giles wrote about his own translation it was not undertaken out of any inflated estimate of my own powers but i could not help feeling that sun tzu deserved a better fate than had befallen him and i knew that at any rate i could hardly fail to improve on the work of my predecessors dr giles was a leading sinologist and an assistant in the department of oriental printed books and manuscripts in the british museum the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom introduction sun wu and his book ssuma chfien gives the following biography of sun tzu sun tzu wu was a native of the chfi state his art of war brought him to the notice of ho lu king of wu ho lu said to him i have carefully perused your chapters may i submit your theory of managing soldiers to a slight test sun tzu replied you may ho lu asked may the test be applied to women the answer was again in the affirmative so arrangements were made to bring ladies out of the palace sun tzu divided them into two companies and placed one of the kings favorite concubines at the head of each he then bade them all take spears in their hands and addressed them thus i presume you know the difference between front and back right hand and left hand the girls replied yes sun tzu went on when i say eyes front you must look straight ahead when i say left turn you must face towards your left hand when i say right turn you must face towards your right hand when i say about turn you must face right round towards your back again the girls assented the words of command having been thus explained he set up the halberds and battleaxes in order to begin the drill then to the sound of drums he gave the order right turn but the girls only burst out laughing sun tzu said if words of command are not clear and distinct if orders are not thoroughly understood then the general is to blame so he started drilling them again and this time gave the order left turn whereupon the girls once more burst into fits of laughter sun tzu if words of command are not clear and distinct if orders are not thoroughly understood the general is to blame but if his orders are clear and the soldiers nevertheless disobey then it is the fault of their officers so saying he ordered the leaders of the two companies to be beheaded now the king of wu was watching the scene from the top of a raised pavilion and when he saw that his favorite concubines were about to be executed he was greatly alarmed and hurriedly sent down the the art of war by sim tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom following message we are now quite satisfied as to our generals ability to handle troops if we are bereft of these two concubines our meat and drink will lose their savor it is our wish that they shall not be beheaded sun tzu replied having once received his majestys commission to be the general of his forces there are certain commands of his majesty which acting in that capacity i am unable to accept accordingly he had the two leaders beheaded and straightway installed the pair next in order as leaders in their place when this had been done the drum was sounded for the drill once more and the girls went through all the evolutions turning to the right or to the left marching ahead or wheeling back kneeling or standing with perfect accuracy and precision not venturing to utter a sound then sun tzu sent a messenger to the king saying your soldiers sire are now properly drilled and disciplined and ready for your majestys inspection they can be put to any use that their sovereign may desire bid them go through fire and water and they will not disobey but the king replied let our general cease drilling and return to camp as for us we have no wish to come down and inspect the troops thereupon sun tzu said the king is only fond of words and cannot translate them into deeds after that ho lu saw that sun tzu was one who knew how to handle an army and finally appointed him general in the west he defeated the chfu state and forced his way into ying the capital to the north he put fear into the states of chf i and chin and spread his fame abroad amongst the feudal princes and sun tzu shared in the might of the king about sun tzu himself this is all that ssuma chf ien has to tell us in this chapter but he proceeds to give a biography of his descendant sun pin born about a hundred years after his famous ancestors death and also the outstanding military genius of his time the historian speaks of him too as sun tzu and in his preface we read sun tzu had his feet cut off and yet continued to discuss the art of war it seems likely then that pin was a nickname bestowed on him after his mutilation unless the story was invented in order to account for the name the crowning incident of his career the crushing defeat of his treacherous rival pang chuan will be found briefly related in chapter v ss note to return to the elder sun tzu he is mentioned in two other passages of the shih chi in the third year of his reign bc ho lu king of wu took the field with tzuhsu ie wu yuan and po pei and attacked chfu he captured the town of shu and slew the two princes sons who had formerly been generals of the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom wu he was then meditating a descent on ying the capital but the general sun wu said the army is exhausted it is not yet possible we must waitafter further successful fighting in the ninth year bc king ho lu addressed wu tzuhsu and sun wu saying formerly you declared that it was not yet possible for us to enter ying is the time ripe now the two men replied chf us general tzu chfang is grasping and covetous and the princes of tang and tsai both have a grudge against him if your majesty has resolved to make a grand attack you must win over tang and tsai and then you may succeed ho lu followed this advice beat chfu in five pitched battles and marched into ying this is the latest date at which anything is recorded of sun wu he does not appear to have survived his patron who died from the effects of a wound in in another chapter there occurs this passage from this time onward a number of famous soldiers arose one after the other kaofan who was employed by the chin state wangtzu in the service of chfi and sun wu in the service of wu these men developed and threw light upon the principles of war it is obvious enough that ssuma chfien at least had no doubt about the reality of sun wu as an historical personage and with one exception to be noticed presently he is by far the most important authority on the period in question it will not be necessary therefore to say much of such a work as the wu yueh chun chiu which is supposed to have been written by chao yeh of the st century ad the attribution is somewhat doubtful but even if it were otherwise his account would be of little value based as it is on the shih chi and expanded with romantic details the story of sun tzu will be found for what it is worth in chapter the only new points in it worth noting are sun tzu was first recommended to ho lu by wu tzuhsu he is called a native of wu he had previously lived a retired life and his contemporaries were unaware of his ability the following passage occurs in the huainan tzu when sovereign and ministers show perversity of mind it is impossible even for a sun tzu to encounter the foe assuming that this work is genuine and hitherto no doubt has been cast upon it we have here the earliest direct reference for sun tzu for huainan tzu died in bc many years before the shih chi was given to the world the art of war by sim tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom liu hsiang bc says the reason why sun tzu at the head of men beat chfu with is that the latter were undisciplined teng mingshih informs us that the surname sun was bestowed on sun wus grandfather by duke ching of chfi bc sun wus father sun ping rose to be a minister of state in chfi and sun wu himself whose style was chf angchf ing fled to wu on account of the rebellion which was being fomented by the kindred of tien pao he had three sons of whom the second named ming was the father of sun pin according to this account then pin was the grandson of wu which considering that sun pins victory over wei was gained in bc may be dismissed as chronological impossible whence these data were obtained by teng mingshih i do not know but of course no reliance whatever can be placed in them an interesting document which has survived from the close of the han period is the short preface written by the great tsao tsao or wei wu ti for his edition of sun tzu i shall give it in full i have heard that the ancients used bows and arrows to their advantage the shu chu mentions the army among the eight objects of government the i ching says army indicates firmness and justice the experienced leader will have good fortune the shih ching says the king rose majestic in his wrath and he marshaled his troops the yellow emperor tang the completer and wu wang all used spears and battleaxes in order to succor their generation the ssuma fa says if one man slay another of set purpose he himself may rightfully be slain he who relies solely on warlike measures shall be exterminated he who relies solely on peaceful measures shall perish instances of this are fu chf ai on the one hand and yen wang on the other in military matters the sages rule is normally to keep the peace and to move his forces only when occasion requires he will not use armed force unless driven to it by necessity many books have i read on the subject of war and fighting but the work composed by sun wu is the profoundest of them all sun tzu was a native of the chfi state his personal name was wu he wrote the art of war in chapters for ho lu king of wu its principles were tested on women and he was subsequently made a general he led an army westwards crushed the chfu state and entered ying the capital in the north he kept chfi and the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom chin in awe a hundred years and more after his time sun pin lived he was a descendant of wu in his treatment of deliberation and planning the importance of rapidity in taking the field clearness of conception and depth of design sun tzu stands beyond the reach of carping criticism my contemporaries however have failed to grasp the full meaning of his instructions and while putting into practice the smaller details in which his work abounds they have overlooked its essential purport that is the motive which has led me to outline a rough explanation of the whole one thing to be noticed in the above is the explicit statement that the chapters were specially composed for king ho lu this is supported by the internal evidence of i ss in which it seems clear that some ruler is addressed in the bibliographic section of the han shu there is an entry which has given rise to much discussion the works of sun tzu of wu in p x ien or chapters with diagrams in chuan it is evident that this cannot be merely the chapters known to ssuma chfien or those we possess today chang shouchieh refers to an edition of sun tzus art of war of which the chapters formed the first chuan adding that there were two other chuan besides this has brought forth a theory that the bulk of these chapters consisted of other writings of sun tzu â€” we should call them apocryphal â€” similar to the wen ta of which a specimen dealing with the nine situations is preserved in the tung tien and another in ho shins commentary it is suggested that before his interview with ho lu sun tzu had only written the chapters but afterwards composed a sort of exegesis in the form of question and answer between himself and the king pi i hsun the author of the sun tzu hsu lu backs this up with a quotation from the wu yueh chun chiu the king of wu summoned sun tzu and asked him questions about the art of war each time he set forth a chapter of his work the king could not find words enough to praise him as he points out if the whole work was expounded on the same scale as in the abovementioned fragments the total number of chapters could not fail to be considerable then the numerous other treatises attributed to sun tzu might be included the fact that the han chih mentions no work of sun tzu except the plen whereas the sui and tang bibliographies give the titles of others in addition to the chapters is good proof pi lhsun thinks that all of these were contained in the plen without pinning our faith to the accuracy of details supplied by the wu yueh citun chiu or admitting the genuineness of any of the the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom treatises cited by pi lhsun we may see in this theory a probable solution of the mystery between ssuma chfien and pan ku there was plenty of time for a luxuriant crop of forgeries to have grown up under the magic name of sun tzu and the plen may very well represent a collected edition of these lumped together with the original work it is also possible though less likely that some of them existed in the time of the earlier historian and were purposely ignored by him tu mus conjecture seems to be based on a passage which states wei wu ti strung together sun wus art of war which in turn may have resulted from a misunderstanding of the final words of tsao kings preface this as sun hsingyen points out is only a modest way of saying that he made an explanatory paraphrase or in other words wrote a commentary on it on the whole this theory has met with very little acceptance thus the ssu icu cituan shu says the mention of the chapters in the shih chi shows that they were in existence before the han chih and that latter accretions are not to be considered part of the original work tu mus assertion can certainly not be taken as proof there is every reason to suppose then that the chapters existed in the time of ssuma chfien practically as we have them now that the work was then well known he tells us in so many words sun tzus chapters and wu chf is art of war are the two books that people commonly refer to on the subject of military matters both of them are widely distributed so i will not discuss them here but as we go further back serious difficulties begin to arise the salient fact which has to be faced is that the tso chuan the greatest contemporary record makes no mention whatsoever of sun wu either as a general or as a writer it is natural in view of this awkward circumstance that many scholars should not only cast doubt on the story of sun wu as given in the shih chi but even show themselves frankly skeptical as to the existence of the man at all the most powerful presentment of this side of the case is to be found in the following disposition by yeh shuihsin it is stated in ssuma chf iens history that sun wu was a native of the chf i state and employed by wu and that in the reign of ho lu he crushed chf u entered ying and was a great general but in tsos commentary no sun wu appears at all it is true that tsos commentary need not contain absolutely everything that other histories contain but tso has not omitted to mention vulgar plebeians and hireling ruffians such as ying icaoshu tsao kuei chu chihwu and chuan shechu in the case of sun wu whose fame and achievements were so brilliant the omission is much more glaring again details are given in the an of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom their due order about his contemporaries wu yuan and the minister p x ei is it credible that sun wu alone should have been passed over in point of literary style sun tzus work belongs to the same school as kuan tzu liu fao and the yueh yu and may have been the production of some private scholar living towards the end of the spring and autumn or the beginning of the warring states period the story that his precepts were actually applied by the wu state is merely the outcome of big talk on the part of his followers from the flourishing period of the chou dynasty down to the time of the spring and autumn all military commanders were statesmen as well and the class of professional generals for conducting external campaigns did not then exist it was not until the period of the six states that this custom changed now although wu was an uncivilized state it is conceivable that tso should have left unrecorded the fact that sun wu was a great general and yet held no civil office what we are told therefore about jangchu and sun wu is not authentic matter but the reckless fabrication of theorizing pundits the story of ho lus experiment on the women in particular is utterly preposterous and incredible yeh shuihsin represents ssuma chf ien as having said that sun wu crushed chf u and entered ying this is not quite correct no doubt the impression left on the readers mind is that he at least shared in these exploits the fact may or may not be significant but it is nowhere explicitly stated in the shih chi either that sun tzu was general on the occasion of the taking of ying or that he even went there at all moreover as we know that wu yuan and po pei both took part in the expedition and also that its success was largely due to the dash and enterprise of fu kai ho lus younger brother it is not easy to see how yet another general could have played a very prominent part in the same campaign chfen chensun of the sung dynasty has the note military writers look upon sun wu as the father of their art but the fact that he does not appear in the tso chuan although he is said to have served under ho lu king of wu makes it uncertain what period he really belonged to he also says the works of sun wu and wu chf i may be of genuine antiquity it is noticeable that both yeh shuihsin and chfen chensun while rejecting the personality of sun wu as he figures in ssuma chf iens history are inclined to accept the date traditionally assigned to the work which passes under his name the author of the hsu lu fails to appreciate this distinction and consequently his bitter attack on chfen the art of war by sxm tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom chensun really misses its mark he makes one of two points however which certainly tell in favor of the high antiquity of our chapters sun tzu he says must have lived in the age of ching wang because he is frequently plagiarized in subsequent works of the chou chun and han dynasties the two most shameless offenders in this respect are wu chfi and huainan tzu both of them important historical personages in their day the former lived only a century after the alleged date of sun tzu and his death is known to have taken place in bc it was to him according to liu hsiang that tseng shen delivered the tso chuan which had been entrusted to him by its author now the fact that quotations from the art of war acknowledged or otherwise are to be found in so many authors of different epochs establishes a very strong anterior to them all â€” in other words that sun tzus treatise was already in existence towards the end of the th century bc further proof of sun tzus antiquity is furnished by the archaic or wholly obsolete meanings attaching to a number of the words he uses a list of these which might perhaps be extended is given in the hsu lu and though some of the interpretations are doubtful the main argument is hardly affected thereby again it must not be forgotten that yeh shuihsin a scholar and critic of the first rank deliberately pronounces the style of the chapters to belong to the early part of the fifth century seeing that he is actually engaged in an attempt to disprove the existence of sun wu himself we may be sure that he would not have hesitated to assign the work to a later date had he not honestly believed the contrary and it is precisely on such a point that the judgment of an educated chinaman will carry most weight other internal evidence is not far to seek thus in xiii ss there is an unmistakable allusion to the ancient system of landtenure which had already passed away by the time of mencius who was anxious to see it revived in a modified form the only warfare sun tzu knows is that carried on between the various feudal princes in which armored chariots play a large part their use seems to have entirely died out before the end of the chou dynasty he speaks as a man of wu a state which ceased to exist as early as bc on this i shall touch presently but once refer the work to the th century or earlier and the chances of its being other than a bona fide production are sensibly diminished the great age of forgeries did not come until long after that it should have been forged in the period immediately following is particularly unlikely for no one as a rule hastens to identify himself with a lost cause as for yeh shuihsins theory that the author was a literary recluse that seems to me quite untenable if one thing is more apparent than another after reading the maxims of sun tzu it is that their essence has been distilled from a large store of personal observation and experience they reflect the mind not only of a born strategist gifted with the art of wai by sim tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom a rare faculty of generalization but also of a practical soldier closely acquainted with the military conditions of his time to say nothing of the fact that these sayings have been accepted and endorsed by all the greatest captains of chinese history they offer a combination of freshness and sincerity acuteness and common sense which quite excludes the idea that they were artificially concocted in the study if we admit then that the chapters were the genuine production of a military man living towards the end of the chtijn citiu period are we not bound in spite of the silence of the tso chuan to accept ssuma chfiens account in its entirety in view of his high repute as a sober historian must we not hesitate to assume that the records he drew upon for sun wus biography were false and untrustworthy the answer i fear must be in the negative there is still one grave if not fatal objection to the chronology involved in the story as told in the shih chi which so far as i am aware nobody has yet pointed out there are two passages in sun tzu in which he alludes to contemporary affairs the first in in vi ss though according to my estimate the soldiers of yueh exceed our own in number that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory i say then that victory can be achieved the other is in xi ss asked if an army can be made to imitate the shuai jan i should answer yes for the men of wu and the men of yueh are enemies yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm they will come to each others assistance just as the left hand helps the right these two paragraphs are extremely valuable as evidence of the date of composition they assign the work to the period of the struggle between wu and yueh so much has been observed by pi lhsun but what has hitherto escaped notice is that they also seriously impair the credibility of ssuma chfiens narrative as we have seen above the first positive date given in connection with sun wu is bc he is then spoken of as a general acting as confidential adviser to ho lu so that his alleged introduction to that monarch had already taken place and of course the chapters must have been written earlier still but at that time and for several years after down to the capture of ying in chfu and not yueh was the great hereditary enemy of wu the two states chfu and wu had been constantly at war for over half a century whereas the first war between wu and yueh was waged only in and even then was no more than a short interlude sandwiched in the midst of the fierce struggle with chfu now chfu is not mentioned in the chapters at all the natural inference is that they were written at a time the an of war by svm tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom when yuen had become the prime antagonist of wu that is after chfu had suffered the great humiliation of at this point a table of dates may be found useful bc v accession of ho lu v ho lu attacks chf u but is dissuaded from entering yingm the capital shi chi mentions sun wu as general v another attack on chfu v wu makes a successful attack on yueh this is the first war between the two states v chfu invades wu but is signally defeated at yu chang v ho lu attacks chfu with the aid of tang and tsai v decisive battle of pochu and capture of ying last mention of sun wu in shih chi v yueh makes a raid on wu in the absence of its army wu is beaten by chf in and evacuates ying v ho lu sends fu chf ai to attack chfu v kou chien becomes king of yueh v wu attacks yueh but is defeated by kou chien at tsuili v ho lu is killed v fu chf ai defeats kou chien in the great battle of fuchaio and enters the capital of yueh or v kou chien renders homage to wu death of wu tzuhsu the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom v kou chien invades wu in the absence of fu chfai to v further attacks by yuen on wu v kou chien lays siege to the capital of wu v final defeat and extinction of wu the sentence quoted above from vi ss hardly strikes me as one that could have been written in the full flush of victory it seems rather to imply that for the moment at least the tide had turned against wu and that she was getting the worst of the struggle hence we may conclude that our treatise was not in existence in before which date yueh does not appear to have scored any notable success against wu ho lu died in so that if the book was written for him it must have been during the period when there was a lull in the hostilities wu having presumably exhausted by its supreme effort against chfu on the other hand if we choose to disregard the tradition connecting sun wus name with ho lu it might equally well have seen the light between and or possibly in the period when yueh was once again becoming a very serious menace we may feel fairly certain that the author whoever he may have been was not a man of any great eminence in his own day on this point the negative testimony of the tso chuan far outweighs any shred of authority still attaching to the shih chi if once its other facts are discredited sun hsingyen however makes a feeble attempt to explain the omission of his name from the great commentary it was wu tzuhsu he says who got all the credit of sun wus exploits because the latter being an alien was not rewarded with an office in the state how then did the sun tzu legend originate it may be that the growing celebrity of the book imparted by degrees a kind of factitious renown to its author it was felt to be only right and proper that one so well versed in the science of war should have solid achievements to his credit as well now the capture of ying was undoubtedly the greatest feat of arms in ho lus reign it made a deep and lasting impression on all the surrounding states and raised wu to the shortlived zenith of her power hence what more natural as time went on than that the acknowledged master of strategy sun wu should be popularly identified with that campaign at first perhaps only in the sense that his brain conceived and planned it afterwards that it was actually carried out by him in conjunction with wu yuan po pei and fu kai the art of wai by sim tzu is the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom it is obvious that any attempt to reconstruct even the outline of sun tzus life must be based almost wholly on conjecture with this necessary proviso i should say that he probably entered the service of wu about the time of ho lus accession and gathered experience though only in the capacity of a subordinate officer during the intense military activity which marked the first half of the princes reign if he rose to be a general at all he certainly was never on an equal footing with the three above mentioned he was doubtless present at the investment and occupation of ying and witnessed wus sudden collapse in the following year yuehs attack at this critical juncture when her rival was embarrassed on every side seems to have convinced him that this upstart kingdom was the great enemy against whom every effort would henceforth have to be directed sun wu was thus a wellseasoned warrior when he sat down to write his famous book which according to my reckoning must have appeared towards the end rather than the beginning of ho lus reign the story of the women may possibly have grown out of some real incident occurring about the same time as we hear no more of sun wu after this from any source he is hardly likely to have survived his patron or to have taken part in the deathstruggle with yueh which began with the disaster at tsuili if these inferences are approximately correct there is a certain irony in the fate which decreed that chinas most illustrious man of peace should be contemporary with her greatest writer on war the an of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom the text of stm tzu i have found it difficult to glean much about the history of sun tzus text the quotations that occur in early authors go to show that the chapters of which ssuma chfien speaks were essentially the same as those now extant we have his word for it that they were widely circulated in his day and can only regret that he refrained from discussing them on that account sun hsingyen says in his preface during the chun and han dynasties sun tzus art of war was in general use amongst military commanders but they seem to have treated it as a work of mysterious import and were unwilling to expound it for the benefit of posterity thus it came about that wei wu was the first to write a commentary on it as we have already seen there is no reasonable ground to suppose that tsao kung tampered with the text but the text itself is often so obscure and the number of editions which appeared from that time onward so great especially during the tang and sung dynasties that it would be surprising if numerous corruptions had not managed to creep in towards the middle of the sung period by which time all the chief commentaries on sun tzu were in existence a certain chi tienpao published a work in chuan entitled sun tzu with the collected commentaries of ten writers there was another text with variant readings put forward by chu fu of tahsing which also had supporters among the scholars of that period but in the ming editions sun hsingyen tells us these readings were for some reason or other no longer put into circulation thus until the end of the th century the text in sole possession of the field was one derived from chi tienpaos edition although no actual copy of that important work was known to have survived that therefore is the text of sun tzu which appears in the war section of the great imperial encyclopedia printed in the ku chin tu shu chi cheng another copy at my disposal of what is practically the same text with slight variations is that contained in the eleven philosophers of the chou and chun dynasties and the chinese printed in capt calthrops first edition is evidently a similar version which has filtered through japanese channels so things remained until sun hsingyen a distinguished antiquarian and classical scholar who claimed to be an actual descendant of sun wu accidentally discovered a copy of chi tienpaos longlost work when on a visit to the library of the huayin temple appended to it was the i shuo of cheng yuhsien mentioned in the tung chih and also believed to have perished this is what sun hsingyen designates as the original the art of wai by stm tzn the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom edition or text â€” a rather misleading name for it cannot by any means claim to set before us the text of sun tzu in its pristine purity chi tien pao was a careless compiler and appears to have been content to reproduce the somewhat debased version current in his day without troubling to collate it with the earliest editions then available fortunately two versions of sun tzu even older than the newly discovered work were still extant one buried in the tung tien tu yus great treatise on the constitution the other similarly enshrined in the ta\ p x ing yu lan encyclopedia in both the complete text is to be found though split up into fragments intermixed with other matter and scattered piecemeal over a number of different sections considering that the yu lan takes us back to the year and the tung tien about years further still to the middle of the tang dynasty the value of these early transcripts of sun tzu can hardly be overestimated yet the idea of utilizing them does not seem to have occurred to anyone until sun hsingyen acting under government instructions undertook a thorough recension of the text this is his own account because of the numerous mistakes in the text of sun tzu which his editors had handed down the government ordered that the ancient edition of chi t x ienpao should be used and that the text should be revised and corrected throughout it happened thatwu nienhu the governor pi kua and hsi a graduate of the second degree had all devoted themselves to this study probably surpassing me therein accordingly i have had the whole work cut on blocks as a textbook for military men the three individuals here referred to had evidently been occupied on the text of sun tzu prior to sun hsingyens commission but we are left in doubt as to the work they really accomplished at any rate the new edition when ultimately produced appeared in the names of sun hsing yen and only one coeditor wu jenshi they took the original edition as their basis and by careful comparison with older versions as well as the extant commentaries and other sources of information such as the i shuo succeeded in restoring a very large number of doubtful passages and turned out on the whole what must be accepted as the closes approximation we are ever likely to get to sun tzus original work this is what will hereafter be denominated the standard text the copy which i have used belongs to a reissue dated it is in pen forming part of a wellprinted set of early philosophical works in pen it opens with a preface by sun hsingyen largely quoted in this introduction vindicating the traditional view of sun tzus life and performances and summing up in remarkably concise fashion the the an of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom evidence in its favor this is followed by tsao kungs preface to his edition and the biography of sun tzu from the shih chi both translated above then come firstly cheng yuhsiens i shuo with authors preface and next a short miscellany of historical and bibliographical information entitled sun tzu hsu lu compiled by pi lhsun as regards the body of the work each separate sentence is followed by a note on the text if required and then by the various commentaries appertaining to it arranged in chronological order these we shall now proceed to discuss briefly one by one the an of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom the coitiineiitato js sun tzu can boast an exceptionally long distinguished roll of commentators which would do honor to any classic ouyang hsiu remarks on this fact though he wrote before the tale was complete and rather ingeniously explains it by saying that the artifices of war being inexhaustible must therefore be susceptible of treatment in a great variety of ways tsao tsao or tsao kung afterwards known as wei wu ti ad there is hardly any room for doubt that the earliest commentary on sun tzu actually came from the pen of this extraordinary man whose biography in the san kuo chih reads like a romance one of the greatest military geniuses that the world has seen and napoleonic in the scale of his operations he was especially famed for the marvelous rapidity of his marches which has found expression in the line talk of tsao tsao and tsao tsao will appear ouyang hsiu says of him that he was a great captain who measured his strength against tung cho lu pu and the two yuan father and son and vanquished them all whereupon he divided the empire of han with wu and shu and made himself king it is recorded that whenever a council of war was held by wei on the eve of a farreaching campaign he had all his calculations ready those generals who made use of them did not lose one battle in ten those who ran counter to them in any particular saw their armies incontinently beaten and put to flight tsao kungs notes on sun tzu models of austere brevity are so thoroughly characteristic of the stern commander known to history that it is hard indeed to conceive of them as the work of a mere litterateur sometimes indeed owing to extreme compression they are scarcely intelligible and stand no less in need of a commentary than the text itself meng shih the commentary which has come down to us under this name is comparatively meager and nothing about the author is known even his personal name has not been recorded chi tienpaos edition places him after chia lin and chfao kungwu also assigns him to the tang dynasty but this is a mistake in sun hsingyens preface he appears as meng shih of the liang dynasty others would identify him with meng icang of the rd century he is named in one work as the last of the five commentators the others being wei wu ti tu mu chf en hao and chia lin li chuan of the th century was a wellknown writer on military tactics one of his works has been in constant use down to the present day the tung chih mentions lives of famous generals from the chou to the tang dynasty as written by him according to chfao kungwu and the tieniko catalogue he followed a variant of the text of sun tzu the ait of wai by sim tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom which differs considerably from those now extant his notes are mostly short and to the point and he frequently illustrates his remarks by anecdotes from chinese history tu yu died did not publish a separate commentary on sun tzu his notes being taken from the tung tien the encyclopedic treatise on the constitution which was his lifework they are largely repetitions of tsao kung and meng shih besides which it is believed that he drew on the ancient commentaries of wang ling and others owing to the peculiar arrangement of tung tien he has to explain each passage on its merits apart from the context and sometimes his own explanation does not agree with that of tsao kung whom he always quotes first though not strictly to be reckoned as one of the ten commentators he was added to their number by chi t x ienpao being wrongly placed after his grandson tu mu tu mu is perhaps the best known as a poet â€” a bright star even in the glorious galaxy of the tang period we learn from chfao kungwu that although he had no practical experience of war he was extremely fond of discussing the subject and was moreover well read in the military history of the citun dtiu and chan kuo eras his notes therefore are well worth attention they are very copious and replete with historical parallels the gist of sun tzus work is thus summarized by him practice benevolence and justice but on the other hand make full use of artifice and measures of expediency he further declared that all the military triumphs and disasters of the thousand years which had elapsed since sun tzus death would upon examination be found to uphold and corroborate in every particular the maxims contained in his book tu mus somewhat spiteful charge against tsao kung has already been considered elsewhere chen hao appears to have been a contemporary of tu mu chfao kungwu says that he was impelled to write a new commentary on sun tzu because tsao kungs on the one hand was too obscure and subtle and that of tu mu on the other too longwinded and diffuse ou yang hsiu writing in the middle of the th century calls tsao kung tu mu and chfen hao the three chief commentators on sun tzu and observes that chfen hao is continually attacking tu mus shortcomings his commentary though not lacking in merit must rank below those of his predecessors chia lin is known to have lived under the tang dynasty for his commentary on sun tzu is mentioned in the tang shu and was afterwards republished by chi hsieh of the same dynasty together with those of meng shih and tu yu it is of somewhat scanty texture and in point of quality too perhaps the least valuable of the eleven the art of wai by sim tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom mei yaochten commonly known by his style as mei shengyu was like tu mu a poet of distinction his commentary was published with a laudatory preface by the great ouyang hsiu from which we may cull the following later scholars have misread sun tzu distorting his words and trying to make them square with their own one sided views thus though commentators have not been lacking only a few have proved equal to the task my friend shengyu has not fallen into this mistake in attempting to provide a critical commentary for sun tzus work he does not lose sight of the fact that these sayings were intended for states engaged in internecine warfare that the author is not concerned with the military conditions prevailing under the sovereigns of the three ancient dynasties nor with the nine punitive measures prescribed to the minister of war again sun wu loved brevity of diction but his meaning is always deep whether the subject be marching an army or handling soldiers or estimating the enemy or controlling the forces of victory it is always systematically treated the sayings are bound together in strict logical sequence though this has been obscured by commentators who have probably failed to grasp their meaning in his own commentary mei shengyu has brushed aside all the obstinate prejudices of these critics and has tried to bring out the true meaning of sun tzu himself in this way the clouds of confusion have been dispersed and the sayings made clear i am convinced that the present work deserves to be handed down side by side with the three great commentaries and for a great deal that they find in the sayings coming generations will have constant reason to thank my friend shengyu making some allowance for the exuberance of friendship i am inclined to endorse this favorable judgment and would certainly place him above chfen hao in order of merit wang hsi also of the sung dynasty is decidedly original in some of his interpretations but much less judicious than mei yaochfen and on the whole not a very trustworthy guide he is fond of comparing his own commentary with that of tsao kung but the comparison is not often flattering to him we learn from chfao kungwu that wang hsi revised the ancient text of sun tzu filling up lacunae and correcting mistakes ho yenhsi of the sung dynasty the personal name of this commentator is given as above by cheng chfiao in the tung chih written about the middle of the twelfth century but he appears simply as the art of wai by sim tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom ho shih in the yu hai and ma tuanlin quotes chfao kungwu as saying that his personal name is unknown there seems to be no reason to doubt cheng chfiaos statement otherwise i should have been inclined to hazard a guess and identify him with one ho chfufei the author of a short treatise on war who lived in the latter part of the th century ho shihs commentary in the words of the tieniko catalogue contains helpful additions here and there but is chiefly remarkable for the copious extracts taken in adapted form from the dynastic histories and other sources chang yu the list closes with a commentator of no great originality perhaps but gifted with admirable powers of lucid exposition his commentator is based on that of tsao kung whose terse sentences he contrives to expand and develop in masterly fashion without chang yu it is safe to say that much of tsao kungs commentary would have remained cloaked in its pristine obscurity and therefore valueless his work is not mentioned in the sung history the tung k x ao or the yu hai but it finds a niche in the tung chih which also names him as the author of the lives of famous generals it is rather remarkable that the lastnamed four should all have flourished within so short a space of time chfao kungwu accounts for it by saying during the early years of the sung dynasty the empire enjoyed a long spell of peace and men ceased to practice the art of war but when chao yuanhaos rebellion came and the frontier generals were defeated time after time the court made strenuous inquiry for men skilled in war and military topics became the vogue amongst all the high officials hence it is that the commentators of sun tzu in our dynasty belong mainly to that period besides these eleven commentators there are several others whose work has not come down to us the sui shu mentions four namely wang ling often quoted by tu yu as wang tzu chang tzu shang chia hsu of wei and shen yu of wu the tang shu adds sun hao and the tung chih hsiao chi while the tu shu mentions a ming commentator huang junyu it is possible that some of these may have been merely collectors and editors of other commentaries like chi t x ienpao and chi hsieh mentioned above the art of wai by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom appreciations of stm tzn sun tzu has exercised a potent fascination over the minds of some of chinas greatest men among the famous generals who are known to have studied his pages with enthusiasm may be mentioned han hsin d bc feng i d ad lu meng d and yo fei the opinion of tsao kung who disputes with han hsin the highest place in chinese military annals has already been recorded still more remarkable in one way is the testimony of purely literary men such as su hsun the father of su tungpo who wrote several essays on military topics all of which owe their chief inspiration to sun tzu the following short passage by him is preserved in the yu hai sun wus saying that in war one cannot make certain of conquering is very different indeed from what other books tell us wu chu was a man of the same stamp as sun wu they both wrote books on war and they are linked together in popular speech as sun and wu but wu chfis remarks on war are less weighty his rules are rougher and more crudely stated and there is not the same unity of plan as in sun tzus work where the style is terse but the meaning fully brought out the following is an extract from the impartial judgments in the garden of literature by cheng hou sun tzus chapters are not only the staple and base of all military mens training but also compel the most careful attention of scholars and men of letters his sayings are terse yet elegant simple yet profound perspicuous and eminently practical such works as the lun yu the i ching and the great commentary as well as the writings of mencius hsun kuang and yang chu all fall below the level of sun tzu chu hsi commenting on this fully admits the first part of the criticism although he dislikes the audacious comparison with the venerated classical works language of this sort he says encourages a rulers bent towards unrelenting warfare and reckless militarism the art of wai by stm tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom apologies f or war accustomed as we are to think of china as the greatest peace loving nation on earth we are in some danger of forgetting that her experience of war in all its phases has also been such as no modern state can parallel her long military annals stretch back to a point at which they are lost in the mists of time she had built the great wall and was maintaining a huge standing army along her frontier centuries before the first roman legionary was seen on the danube what with the perpetual collisions of the ancient feudal states the grim conflicts with huns turks and other invaders after the centralization of government the terrific upheavals which accompanied the overthrow of so many dynasties besides the countless rebellions and minor disturbances that have flamed up and flickered out again one by one it is hardly too much to say that the clash of arms has never ceased to resound in one portion or another of the empire no less remarkable is the succession of illustrious captains to whom china can point with pride as in all countries the greatest are fond of emerging at the most fateful crises of her history thus po chfi stands out conspicuous in the period when chun was entering upon her final struggle with the remaining independent states the stormy years which followed the breakup of the chun dynasty are illuminated by the transcendent genius of han hsin when the house of han in turn is tottering to its fall the great and baleful figure of tsao tsao dominates the scene and in the establishment of the tang dynasty one of the mightiest tasks achieved by man the superhuman energy of li shihmin afterwards the emperor tai tsung was seconded by the brilliant strategy of li ching none of these generals need fear comparison with the greatest names in the military history of europe in spite of all this the great body of chinese sentiment from lao tzu downwards and especially as reflected in the standard literature of confucianism has been consistently pacific and intensely opposed to militarism in any form it is such an uncommon thing to find any of the literati defending warfare on principle that i have thought it worth while to collect and translate a few passages in which the unorthodox view is upheld the following by ssuma chfien shows that for all his ardent admiration of confucius he was yet no advocate of peace at any price military weapons are the means used by the sage to punish violence and cruelty to give peace to troublous times to remove difficulties and dangers and to succor those who are in peril every animal with blood in its veins and horns on its head will fight when it is attacked how the art of wai by sim tzu s the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom much more so will man who carries in his breast the faculties of love and hatred joy and anger when he is pleased a feeling of affection springs up within him when angry his poisoned sting is brought into play that is the natural law which governs his being what then shall be said of those scholars of our time blind to all great issues and without any appreciation of relative values who can only bark out their stale formulas about virtue and civilization condemning the use of military weapons they will surely bring our country to impotence and dishonor and the loss of her rightful heritage or at the very least they will bring about invasion and rebellion sacrifice of territory and general enfeeblement yet they obstinately refuse to modify the position they have taken up the truth is that just as in the family the teacher must not spare the rod and punishments cannot be dispensed with in the state so military chastisement can never be allowed to fall into abeyance in the empire all one can say is that this power will be exercised wisely by some foolishly by others and that among those who bear arms some will be loyal and others rebellious the next piece is taken from tu mus preface to his commentary on sun tzu war may be defined as punishment which is one of the functions of government it was the profession of chung yu and jan chfiu both disciples of confucius nowadays the holding of trials and hearing of litigation the imprisonment of offenders and their execution by flogging in the market place are all done by officials but the wielding of huge armies the throwing down of fortified cities the hauling of women and children into captivity and the beheading of traitors â€” this is also work which is done by officials the objects of the rack and of military weapons are essentially the same there is no intrinsic difference between the punishment of flogging and cutting off heads in war for the lesser infractions of law which are easily dealt with only a small amount of force need be employed hence the use of military weapons and wholesale decapitation in both cases however the end in view is to get rid of wicked people and to give comfort and relief to the good chisun asked jan yu saying have you sir acquired your military aptitude by study or is it innate jan yu replied it has been the art of wai by srni tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom acquired by study how can that be so said chisun seeing that you are a disciple of confucius it is a fact replied jan yu i was taught by confucius it is fitting that the great sage should exercise both civil and military functions though to be sure my instruction in the art of fighting has not yet gone very far now who the author was of this rigid distinction between the civil and the military and the limitation of each to a separate sphere of action or in what year of which dynasty it was first introduced is more than i can say but at any rate it has come about that the members of the governing class are quite afraid of enlarging on military topics or do so only in a shamefaced manner if any are bold enough to discuss the subject they are at once set down as eccentric individuals of coarse and brutal propensities this is an extraordinary instance in which through sheer lack of reasoning men unhappily lose sight of fundamental principles when the duke of chou was minister under chfeng wang he regulated ceremonies and made music and venerated the arts of scholarship and learning yet when the barbarians of the river huai revolted he sallied forth and chastised them when confucius held office under the duke of lu and a meeting was convened at chiaku he said if pacific negotiations are in progress warlike preparations should have been made beforehand he rebuked and shamed the marquis of chfi who cowered under him and dared not proceed to violence how can it be said that these two great sages had no knowledge of military matters we have seen that the great chu hsi held sun tzu in high esteem he also appeals to the authority of the classics our master confucius answering duke ling of wei said i have never studied matters connected with armies and battalions replying to kung wentzu he said i have not been instructed about buffcoats and weapons but if we turn to the meeting at chiaku we find that he used armed force against the men of lai so that the marquis of chu was overawed again when the inhabitants of pi revolted the ordered his officers to attack them whereupon they were defeated and fled in confusion he once uttered the words if i fight i conquer and jan yu also said the sage exercises both civil and military functions can it be a fact that confucius never studied or received instruction in the art of war we can only say that he did not specially choose matters connected with armies and fighting to be the subject of his teaching the art of wai by sim tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom sun hsingyen the editor of sun tzu writes in similar strain confucius said i am unversed in military matters he also said if i fight i conquer confucius ordered ceremonies and regulated music now war constitutes one of the five classes of state ceremonial and must not be treated as an independent branch of study hence the words i am unversed in must be taken to mean that there are things which even an inspired teacher does not know those who have to lead an army and devise stratagems must learn the art of war but if one can command the services of a good general like sun tzu who was employed by wu tzuhsu there is no need to learn it oneself hence the remark added by confucius if i fight i conquer the men of the present day however willfully interpret these words of confucius in their narrowest sense as though he meant that books on the art of war were not worth reading with blind persistency they adduce the example of chao kua who pored over his fathers books to no purpose as a proof that all military theory is useless again seeing that books on war have to do with such things as opportunism in designing plans and the conversion of spies they hold that the art is immoral and unworthy of a sage these people ignore the fact that the studies of our scholars and the civil administration of our officials also require steady application and practice before efficiency is reached the ancients were particularly chary of allowing mere novices to botch their work weapons are baneful and fighting perilous and useless unless a general is in constant practice he ought not to hazard other mens lives in battle hence it is essential that sun tzus chapters should be studied hsiang liang used to instruct his nephew chi in the art of war chi got a rough idea of the art in its general bearings but would not pursue his studies to their proper outcome the consequence being that he was finally defeated and overthrown he did not realize that the tricks and artifices of war are beyond verbal computation duke hsiang of sung and king yen of hsu were brought to destruction by their misplaced humanity the treacherous and underhand nature of war necessitates the use of guile and stratagem suited to the occasion there is a case on record of confucius himself having violated an extorted oath and also of his having left the sung state in disguise can we then recklessly arraign sun tzu for disregarding truth and honesty the art of wai by srni tzu the puppet

arts in general liu fao in chuan or chapters attributed to lu wang or lu shang also known as tai kung of the th century bc but its style does not belong to the era of the three dynasties lu teming ad

refers to the deliberations in the temple selected by the general for his temporary use or as we should say in his tent see ss sun tzu said the art of war is of vital importance to the state it is a matter of life and death a road either to safety or to ruin hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected the art of war then is governed by five constant factors to be taken into account in ones deliberations when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field these are the moral law heaven earth the commander method and discipline it appears from what follows that sun tzu means by moral law a principle of harmony not unlike the tao of lao tzu in its moral aspect one might be tempted to render it by morale were it not considered as an attribute of the ruler in ss the moral law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler so that they will follow him regardless of their lives undismayed by any danger tu yu quotes wang tzu as saying without constant practice the officers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle without constant practice the general will be wavering and irresolute when the crisis is at hand the art of wai by srni tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom heaven signifies night and day cold and heat times and seasons the commentators i think make an unnecessary mystery of two words here meng shih refers to the hard and the soft waxing and waning of heaven wang hsi however may be right in saying that what is meant is the general economy of heaven including the five elements the four seasons wind and clouds and other phenomena earth comprises distances great and small danger and security open ground and narrow passes the chances of life and death the commander stands for the virtues of wisdom sincerely benevolence courage and strictness the five cardinal virtues of the chinese are humanity or benevolence uprightness of mind self respect selfcontrol or proper feeling wisdom sincerity or good faith here wisdom and sincerity are put before humanity or benevolence and the two military virtues of courage and strictness substituted for uprightness of mind and selfrespect selfcontrol or proper feeling by method and disci pli ne are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions the graduations of rank among the officers the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army and the control of military expenditure these five heads should be familiar to every general he who knows them will be victorious he who knows them not will fail therefore in your deliberations when seeking to determine the military conditions let them be made the basis of a comparison in this wise which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the moral law ie is in harmony with his subjects cf ss the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom which of the two generals has most ability with whom lie the advantages derived from heaven and earth see ss on which side is discipline most rigorously enforced tu mu alludes to the remarkable story of tsao tsao ad who was such a strict disciplinarian that once in accordance with his own severe regulations against injury to standing crops he condemned himself to death for having allowed him horse to shy into a field of corn however in lieu of losing his head he was persuaded to satisfy his sense of justice by cutting off his hair tsao tsaos own comment on the present passage is characteristically curt when you lay down a law see that it is not disobeyed if it is disobeyed the offender must be put to death which army is stronger morally as well as physically as mei yaochf en puts it freely rendered espirit de corps and big battalions on which side are officers and men more highly trained tu yu quotes wang tzu as saying without constant practice the officers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle without constant practice the general will be wavering and irresolute when the crisis is at hand in which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment n which side is there the most absolute certainty that merit will be properly rewarded and misdeeds summarily punished by means of these seven considerations i can forecast victory or defeat the general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it will conquer â€” let such a one be retained in command the general that hearkens not to my the art of wai by srni tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom counsel nor acts upon it will suffer defeat â€” let such a one be dismissed the form of this paragraph reminds us that suntzus treatise was composed expressly for the benefit of his patron h o lu king of the w u state while heading the profit of my counsel avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules according as circumstances are favorable one should modify ones plans sun tzu as a practical soldier will have none of the bookish theoric he cautions us here not to pin our faith to abstract principles for as chang yu puts it while the main laws of strategy can be stated clearly enough for the benefit of all and sundry you must be guided by the actions of the enemy in attempting to secure a favorable position in actual warfare on the eve of the battle of waterloo lord uxbridge commanding the cavalry went to the duke of wellington in order to learn what his plans and calculations were for the morrow because as he explained he might suddenly find himself commanderinchief and would be unable to frame new plans in a critical moment the duke listened quietly and then said who will attack the first tomorrow â€” i or bonaparte bonaparte replied lord uxbridge well continued the duke bonaparte has not given me any idea of his projects and as my plans will depend upon his how can you expect me to tell you what mine are all warfare is based on deception the truth of this pithy and profound saying will be admitted by every soldier col henderson tells us that wellington great in so many military qualities was especially distinguished by the extraordinary skill with which he concealed his movements and deceived both friend and foe hence when able to attack we must seem unable when using our forces we must seem inactive when we are near we must make the enemy believe we the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom are far away when far away we must make him believe we are near hold out baits to entice the enemy feign disorder and crush him all commentators except chang yu say when he is in disorder crush him it is more natural to suppose that sun tzu is still illustrating the uses of deception in war if he is secure at all points be prepared for him if he is in superior strength evade him if your opponent is of choleric temper seek to irritate him pretend to be weak that he may grow arrogant wang tzu quoted by tu yu says that the good tactician plays with his adversary as a cat plays with a mouse first feigning weakness and immobility and then suddenly pouncing upon him if he is taking his ease give him no rest this is probably the meaning though mei yaochf en has the note while we are taking our ease wait for the enemy to tire himself out the yu lan has lure him on and tire him out if his forces are united separate them less plausible is the interpretation favored by most of the commentators if sovereign and subject are in accord put division between them attack him where he is unprepared appear where you are not expected these military devices leading to victory must not be divulged beforehand now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought chang yu tells us that in ancient times it was customary for a temple to be set apart for the use of a general who was about to take the field in order that he might there elaborate his plan of campaign the an of war by son tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom the general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand thus do many calculations lead to victory and few calculations to defeat how much more no calculation at all it is by attention to this point that i can foresee who is likely to win or lose words on wellington by sir w fraser the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom ii waging war tsao kung has the note he who wishes to fight must first count the cost which prepares us for the discovery that the subject of the chapter is not what we might expect from the title but is primarily a consideration of ways and means sun tzu said in the operations of war where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots as many heavy chariots and a hundred thousand mailclad soldiers the swift chariots were lightly built and according to chang yu used for the attack the heavy chariots were heavier and designed for purposes of defense li chfuan it is true says that the latter were light but this seems hardly probable it is interesting to note the analogies between early chinese warfare and that of the homeric greeks in each case the warchariot was the important factor forming as it did the nucleus round which was grouped a certain number of footsoldiers with regard to the numbers given here we are informed that each swift chariot was accompanied by footmen and each heavy chariot by footmen so that the whole army would be divided up into a thousand battalions each consisting of two chariots and a hundred men with provisions enough to carry them a thousand li modern li go to a mile the length may have varied slightly since sun tzus time the expenditure at home and at the front including entertainment of guests small items such as glue and paint and sums spent on chariots and armor will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day such is the cost of raising an army of men when you engage in actual fighting if victory is long in coming then mens weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be damped if you lay siege to a town you will exhaust your strength the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom again if the campaign is protracted the resources of the state will not be equal to the strain now when your weapons are dulled your ardor damped your strength exhausted and your treasure spent other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity then no man however wise will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue thus though we have heard of stupid haste in war cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays this concise and difficult sentence is not well explained by any of the commentators tsao kung li chfuan meng shih tu yu tu mu and mei yaochfen have notes to the effect that a general though naturally stupid may nevertheless conquer through sheer force of rapidity ho shih says haste may be stupid but at any rate it saves expenditure of energy and treasure protracted operations may be very clever but they bring calamity in their train wang hsi evades the difficulty by remarking lengthy operations mean an army growing old wealth being expended an empty exchequer and distress among the people true cleverness insures against the occurrence of such calamities chang yu says so long as victory can be attained stupid haste is preferable to clever dilatoriness now sun tzu says nothing whatever except possibly by implication about illconsidered haste being better than ingenious but lengthy operations what he does say is something much more guarded namely that while speed may sometimes be injudicious tardiness can never be anything but foolish â€” if only because it means impoverishment to the nation in considering the point raised here by sun tzu the classic example of fabius cunctator will inevitably occur to the mind that general deliberately measured the endurance of rome against that of hannibalss isolated army because it seemed to him that the latter was more likely to suffer from a long campaign in a strange country but it is quite a moot question whether his tactics would have proved successful in the long run their the art of wai by sim tzu â£ the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom reversal it is true led to cannae but this only establishes a negative presumption in their favor there is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare it is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on that is with rapidity only one who knows the disastrous effects of a long war can realize the supreme importance of rapidity in bringing it to a close only two commentators seem to favor this interpretation but it fits well into the logic of the context whereas the rendering he who does not know the evils of war cannot appreciate its benefits is distinctly pointless the skillful soldier does not raise a second levy neither are his supplywagons loaded more than twice once war is declared he will not waste precious time in waiting for reinforcements nor will he return his army back for fresh supplies but crosses the enemys frontier without delay this may seem an audacious policy to recommend but with all great strategists from julius caesar to napoleon bonaparte the value of time â€” that is being a little ahead of your opponent has counted for more than either numerical superiority or the nicest calculations with regard to commissariat bring war material with you from home but forage on the enemy thus the army will have food enough for its needs the chinese word translated here as war material literally means things to be used and is meant in the widest sense it includes all the impedimenta of an army apart from provisions poverty of the state exchequer causes an army to be maintained by contributions from a distance contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom the beginning of this sentence does not balance properly with the next though obviously intended to do so the arrangement moreover is so awkward that i cannot help suspecting some corruption in the text it never seems to occur to chinese commentators that an emendation may be necessary for the sense and we get no help from them there the chinese words sun tzu used to indicate the cause of the peoples impoverishment clearly have reference to some system by which the husbandmen sent their contributions of corn to the army direct but why should it fall on them to maintain an army in this way except because the state or government is too poor to do so on the other hand the proximity of an army causes prices to go up and high prices cause the peoples substance to be drained away wang hsi says high prices occur before the army has left its own territory tsao kung understands it of an army that has already crossed the frontier when their substance is drained away the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions with this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength the homes of the people will be stripped bare and threetenths of their income will be dissipated tu mu and wang hsi agree that the people are not mulcted not of but of of their income but this is hardly to be extracted from our text ho shih has a characteristic tag the people being regarded as the essential part of the state and food as the peoples heaven is it not right that those in authority should value and be careful of both while government expenses for broken chariots wornout horses breastplates and helmets bows and arrows spears and shields protective mantles draughtoxen and heavy wagons will amount to four tenths of its total revenue the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy one cartload of the enemys provisions is equivalent to twenty of ones own and likewise a single picul of his provender is equivalent to twenty from ones own store because twenty cartloads will be consumed in the process of transporting one cartload to the front a picul is a unit of measure equal to pounds kilograms now in order to kill the enemy our men must be roused to anger that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy they must have their rewards tu mu says rewards are necessary in order to make the soldiers see the advantage of beating the enemy thus when you capture spoils from the enemy they must be used as rewards so that all your men may have a keen desire to fight each on his own account therefore in chariot fighting when ten or more chariots have been taken those should be rewarded who took the first our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours the captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept this is called using the conquered foe to augment ones own strength in war then let your great object be victory not lengthy campaigns as ho shih remarks war is not a thing to be trifled with sun tzu here reiterates the main lesson which this chapter is intended to enforce thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the peoples fate the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril the art of wai by sim tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom iii attack by stxategem sun tzu said in the practical art of war the best thing of all is to take the enemys country whole and intact to shatter and destroy it is not so good so too it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it to capture a regiment a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them the equivalent to an army corps according to ssuma fa consisted nominally of men according to tsao kung the equivalent of a regiment contained men the equivalent to a detachment consists from any number between and and the equivalent of a company contains from to men for the last two however chang yu gives the exact figures of and respectively hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemys resistance without fighting here again no modern strategist but will approve the words of the old chinese general moltkes greatest triumph the capitulation of the huge french army at sedan was won practically without bloodshed thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemys plans perhaps the word balk falls short of expressing the full force of the chinese word which implies not an attitude of defense whereby one might be content to foil the enemys stratagems one after another but an active policy of counterattack ho shih puts this very clearly in his note when the enemy has made a plan of attack against us we must anticipate him by delivering our own attack first the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemys forces isolating him from his allies we must not forget that sun tzu in speaking of hostilities always has in mind the numerous states or principalities into which the china of his day was split up the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom the next in order is to attack the enemys army in the field when he is already at full strength and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities the rule is not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided another sound piece of military theory had the boers acted upon it in and refrained from dissipating their strength before kimberley mafeking or even ladysmith it is more than probable that they would have been masters of the situation before the british were ready seriously to oppose them the preparation of mantlets movable shelters and various implements of war will take up three whole months it is not quite clear what the chinese word here translated as mantlets described tsao kung simply defines them as large shields but we get a better idea of them from li chfuan who says they were to protect the heads of those who were assaulting the city walls at close quarters this seems to suggest a sort of roman testudo ready made tu mu says they were wheeled vehicles used in repelling attacks but this is denied by chfen hao see supra ii the name is also applied to turrets on city walls of the movable shelters we get a fairly clear description from several commentators they were wooden missileproof structures on four wheels propelled from within covered over with raw hides and used in sieges to convey parties of men to and from the walls for the purpose of filling up the encircling moat with earth tu mu adds that they are now called wooden donkeys and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more these were great mounds or ramparts of earth heaped up to the level of the enemys walls in order to discover the weak points in the defense and also to destroy the fortified turrets mentioned in the preceding note the art of wai by stm tzn the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom the general unable to control his irritation will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants this vivid simile of tsao kung is taken from the spectacle of an army of ants climbing a wall the meaning is that the general losing patience at the long delay may make a premature attempt to storm the place before his engines of war are ready with the result that onethird of his men are slain while the town still remains untaken such are the disastrous effects of a siege we are reminded of the terrible losses of the japanese before port arthur in the most recent siege which history has to record therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemys troops without any fighting he captures their cities without laying siege to them he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field chia lin notes that he only overthrows the government but does no harm to individuals the classical instance is wu wang who after having put an end to the yin dynasty was acclaimed father and mother of the people with his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the empire and thus without losing a man his triumph will be complete owing to the double meanings in the chinese text the latter part of the sentence is susceptible of quite a different meaning and thus the weapon not being blunted by use its keenness remains perfect this is the method of attacking by stratagem it is the rule in war if our forces are ten to the enemys one to surround him if five to one to attack him straightway without waiting for any further advantage if twice as numerous to divide our army into two the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom tu mu takes exception to the saying and at first sight indeed it appears to violate a fundamental principle of war tsao kung however gives a clue to sun tzus meaning being two to the enemys one we may use one part of our army in the regular way and the other for some special diversion chang yu thus further elucidates the point if our force is twice as numerous as that of the enemy it should be split up into two divisions one to meet the enemy in front and one to fall upon his rear if he replies to the frontal attack he may be crushed from behind if to the rearward attack he may be crushed in front this is what is meant by saying that one part may be used in the regular way and the other for some special diversion tu mu does not understand that dividing ones army is simply an irregular just as concentrating it is the regular strategical method and he is too hasty in calling this a mistake if equally matched we can offer battle li chf uan followed by ho shih gives the following paraphrase if attackers and attacked are equally matched in strength only the able general will fight if slightly inferior in numbers we can avoid the enemy the meaning we can watch the enemy is certainly a great improvement on the above but unfortunately there appears to be no very good authority for the variant chang yu reminds us that the saying only applies if the other factors are equal a small difference in numbers is often more than counterbalanced by superior energy and discipline if quite unequal in every way we can flee from him hence though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force in the end it must be captured by the larger force now the general is the bulwark of the state if the bulwark is complete at all points the state will be strong if the bulwark is defective the state will be weak the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom as li chfuan tersely puts it gap indicates deficiency if the generals ability is not perfect ie if he is not thoroughly versed in his profession his army will lack strength there are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army by commanding the army to advance or to retreat being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey this is called hobbling the army li chf uan adds the comment it is like tying together the legs of a thoroughbred so that it is unable to gallop one would naturally think of the ruler in this passage as being at home and trying to direct the movements of his army from a distance but the commentators understand just the reverse and quote the saying of tai kung a kingdom should not be governed from without and army should not be directed from within of course it is true that during an engagement or when in close touch with the enemy the general should not be in the thick of his own troops but a little distance apart otherwise he will be liable to misjudge the position as a whole and give wrong orders by attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army this causes restlessness in the soldiers minds tsao kungs note is freely translated the military sphere and the civil sphere are wholly distinct you cant handle an army in kid gloves and chang yu says humanity and justice are the principles on which to govern a state but not an army opportunism and flexibility on the other hand are military rather than civil virtues to assimilate the governing of an army â€” to that of a state understood by employing the officers of his army without discrimination that is he is not careful to use the right man in the right place the art of wai by srni tzn so the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances this shakes the confidence of the soldiers i follow mei yaochf en here the other commentators refer not to the ruler as in ss but to the officers he employs thus tu yu says if a general is ignorant of the principle of adaptability he must not be entrusted with a position of authority tu mu quotes the skillful employer of men will employ the wise man the brave man the covetous man and the stupid man for the wise man delights in establishing his merit the brave man likes to show his courage in action the covetous man is quick at seizing advantages and the stupid man has no fear of death but when the army is restless and distrustful trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes this is simply bringing anarchy into the army and flinging victory away thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory he will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight chang yu says if he can fight he advances and takes the offensive if he cannot fight he retreats and remains on the defensive he will invariably conquer who knows whether it is right to take the offensive or the defensive he will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces this is not merely the generals ability to estimate numbers correctly as li chfuan and others make out chang yu expounds the saying more satisfactorily by applying the art of war it is possible with a lesser force to defeat a greater and vice versa the secret lies in an eye for locality and in not letting the right moment slip thus wu tzu says with a superior force make for easy ground with an inferior one make for difficult ground he will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks the art of wai by sim tzu si the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom he will win who prepared himself waits to take the enemy unprepared he will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign tu yu quotes wang tzu as saying it is the sovereigns function to give broad instructions but to decide on battle it is the function of the general it is needless to dilate on the military disasters which have been caused by undue interference with operations in the field on the part of the home government napoleon undoubtedly owed much of his extraordinary success to the fact that he was not hampered by central authority hence the saying if you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the result of a hundred battles if you know yourself but not the enemy for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat li chf uan cites the case of fu chien prince of chun who in ad marched with a vast army against the chin emperor when warned not to despise an enemy who could command the services of such men as hsieh an and huan chf ung he boastfully replied i have the population of eight provinces at my back infantry and horsemen to the number of one million why they could dam up the yangtsze river itself by merely throwing their whips into the stream what danger have i to fear nevertheless his forces were soon after disastrously routed at the fei river and he was obliged to beat a hasty retreat if you know neither the enemy nor yourself you will succumb in every battle chang yu said knowing the enemy enables you to take the offensive knowing yourself enables you to stand on the defensive he adds attack is the secret of defense defense is the planning of an attack it would be hard to find a better epitome of the rootprinciple of war the art of wai by sim tzu s the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom iv tactical dispostftims tsao kung explains the chinese meaning of the words for the title of this chapter marching and countermarching on the part of the two armies with a view to discovering each others condition tu mu says it is through the dispositions of an army that its condition may be discovered conceal your dispositions and your condition will remain secret which leads to victory show your dispositions and your condition will become patent which leads to defeat wang hsi remarks that the good general can secure success by modifying his tactics to meet those of the enemy sun tzu said the good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself that is of course by a mistake on the enemys part thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat chang yu says this is done by concealing the disposition of his troops covering up his tracks and taking unremitting precautions but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy hence the saying one may know how to conquer without being able to do it security against defeat implies defensive tactics ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive i retain the sense found in a similar passage in ss in spite of the fact that the commentators are all against me the meaning they give he who cannot conquer takes the defensive is plausible enough the art of wai by srni tzu s the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength attacking a superabundance of strength the general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth literally hides under the ninth earth which is a metaphor indicating the utmost secrecy and concealment so that the enemy may not know his whereabouts he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven another metaphor implying that he falls on his adversary like a thunderbolt against which there is no time to prepare this is the opinion of most of the commentators thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves on the other a victory that is complete to see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence as tsao kung remarks the thing is to see the plant before it has germinated to foresee the event before the action has begun li chfuan alludes to the story of han hsin who when about to attack the vastly superior army of chao which was strongly entrenched in the city of chfengan said to his officers gentlemen we are going to annihilate the enemy and shall meet again at dinner the officers hardly took his words seriously and gave a very dubious assent but han hsin had already worked out in his mind the details of a clever stratagem whereby as he foresaw he was able to capture the city and inflict a crushing defeat on his adversary neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole empire says well done true excellence being as tu mu says to plan secretly to move surreptitiously to foil the enemys intentions and balk his schemes so that at last the day may be won without shedding a drop of blood sun tzu reserves his approbation for things that the worlds coarse thumb and finger fail to plumb the art of wai by sim tzu s the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom to lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength autumn hair is explained as the fur of a hare which is finest in autumn when it begins to grow afresh the phrase is a very common one in chinese writers to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear ho shih gives as real instances of strength sharp sight and quick hearing wu huo who could lift a tripod weighing stone li chu who at a distance of a hundred paces could see objects no bigger than a mustard seed and shih kuang a blind musician who could hear the footsteps of a mosquito what the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins but excels in winning with ease the last half is literally one who conquering excels in easy conquering mei yaochf en says he who only sees the obvious wins his battles with difficulty he who looks below the surface of things wins with ease hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage tu mu explains this very well inasmuch as his victories are gained over circumstances that have not come to light the world as large knows nothing of them and he wins no reputation for wisdom inasmuch as the hostile state submits before there has been any bloodshed he receives no credit for courage he wins his battles by making no mistakes chf en hao says he plans no superfluous marches he devises no futile attacks the connection of ideas is thus explained by chang yu one who seeks to conquer by sheer strength clever though he may be at winning pitched battles is also liable on occasion to be vanquished whereas he who can look into the future and discern conditions that are not yet manifest will never make a blunder and therefore invariably win making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated the art of wai by sim izu ss the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy a counsel of perfection as tu mu truly observes position need not be confined to the actual ground occupied by the troops it includes all the arrangements and preparations which a wise general will make to increase the safety of his army thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory ho shih thus expounds the paradox in warfare first lay plans which will ensure victory and then lead your army to battle if you will not begin with stratagem but rely on brute strength alone victory will no longer be assured the consummate leader cultivates the moral law and strictly adheres to method and discipline thus it is in his power to control success in respect of military method we have firstly measurement secondly estimation of quantity thirdly calculation fourthly balancing of chances fifthly victory measurement owes its existence to earth estimation of quantity to measurement calculation to estimation of quantity balancing of chances to calculation and victory to balancing of chances it is not easy to distinguish the four terms very clearly in the chinese the first seems to be surveying and measurement of the ground which enable us to form an estimate of the enemys strength and to make calculations based on the data thus obtained we are thus led to a general weighingup or comparison of the enemys chances with our own if the latter turn the scale then victory ensues the chief difficulty lies in third term which in the chinese some commentators take as a calculation of numbers thereby making it nearly synonymous with the second term the art of wai by srni tzn sg the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom perhaps the second term should be thought of as a consideration of the enemys general position or condition while the third term is the estimate of his numerical strength on the other hand tu mu says the question of relative strength having been settled we can bring the varied resources of cunning into play ho shih seconds this interpretation but weakens it however it points to the third term as being a calculation of numbers a victorious army opposed to a routed one is as a pounds weight placed in the scale against a single grain literally a victorious army is like an i oz weighed against a shu oz a routed army is a shu weighed against an i the point is simply the enormous advantage which a disciplined force flushed with victory has over one demoralized by defeat legge in his note on mencius i ix makes the i to be chinese ounces and corrects chu hsis statement that it equaled oz only but li chfuan of the tang dynasty here gives the same figure as chu hsi the onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pentup waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep the art of wai by sim izu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom v energy sun tzu said the control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers that is cutting up the army into regiments companies etc with subordinate officers in command of each tu mu reminds us of han hsins famous reply to the first han emperor who once said to him how large an army do you think i could lead not more than men your majesty and you asked the emperor oh he answered the more the better fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals to ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemys attack and remain unshaken this is effected by maneuvers direct and indirect we now come to one of the most interesting parts of sun tzus treatise the discussion of the cheng and the chi as it is by no means easy to grasp the full significance of these two terms or to render them consistently by good english equivalents it may be as well to tabulate some of the commentators remarks on the subject before proceeding further li chf uan facing the enemy is cheng making lateral diversion is ch x i chia lin in presence of the enemy your troops should be arrayed in normal fashion but in order to secure victory abnormal maneuvers must be employed mei yaochf en ch x i is active cheng is passive passivity means waiting for an opportunity activity beings the victory itself ho shih we must cause the enemy to regard our straightforward attack as one that is secretly designed and vice versa thus cheng may also be clh and chti may also be cheng he instances the famous exploit of han hsin who when marching ostensibly against linchin now chaoi in shensi suddenly threw a large force across the yellow river in wooden tubs utterly disconcerting his opponent chfien the art of wai by srni tzu s the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom han shu ch here we are told the march on linchin was cheng and the surprise maneuver was chi chang yu gives the following summary of opinions on the words military writers do not agree with regard to the meaning of ch x i and cheng wei liao tzu th cent bc says direct warfare favors frontal attacks indirect warfare attacks from the rear tsao kung says going straight out to join battle is a direct operation appearing on the enemys rear is an indirect maneuver li weikung th and th cent ad says in war to march straight ahead is cheng turning movements on the other hand are ch x i these writers simply regard cheng as cheng and chti as citi they do not note that the two are mutually interchangeable and run into each other like the two sides of a circle see infra ss a comment on the tang emperor tai tsung goes to the root of the matter a chi maneuver may be cheng if we make the enemy look upon it as cheng then our real attack will be ch x i and vice versa the whole secret lies in confusing the enemy so that he cannot fathom our real intent to put it perhaps a little more clearly any attack or other operation is cheng on which the enemy has had his attention fixed whereas that is ch x i which takes him by surprise or comes from an unexpected quarter if the enemy perceives a movement which is meant to be chi it immediately becomes cheng that the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg this is effected by the science of weak points and strong in all fighting the direct method may be used for joining battle but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory chang yu says steadily develop indirect tactics either by pounding the enemys flanks or falling on his rear a brilliant example of indirect tactics which decided the fortunes of a campaign was lord roberts night march round the peiwar kotal in the second afghan war indirect tactics efficiently applied are inexhaustible as heaven and earth unending as the flow of rivers and streams like the sun and moon they end but to the art of wai by srni tzu s the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom begin anew like the four seasons they pass away to return once more tu yu and chang yu understand this of the permutations of citi and cheng but at present sun tzu is not speaking of cheng at all unless indeed we suppose with cheng yuhsien that a clause relating to it has fallen out of the text of course as has already been pointed out the two are so inextricably interwoven in all military operations that they cannot really be considered apart here we simply have an expression in figurative language of the almost infinite resource of a great leader there are not more than five musical notes yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard there are not more than five primary colors blue yellow red white and black yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen there are not more than five cardinal tastes sour acrid salt sweet bitter yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted in battle there are not more than two methods of attack the direct and the indirect yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers the direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn it is like moving in a circle you never come to an end who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination the onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course the quality of decision is like the welltimed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim the chinese here is tricky and a certain key word in the context it is used defies the best efforts of the translator tu mu defines this word as the measurement or estimation of the art of war by sun tzu go the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom distance but this meaning does not quite fit the illustrative simile in ss applying this definition to the falcon it seems to me to denote that instinct of self restraint which keeps the bird from swooping on its quarry until the right moment together with the power of judging when the right moment has arrived the analogous quality in soldiers is the highly important one of being able to reserve their fire until the very instant at which it will be most effective when the victory went into action at trafalgar at hardly more than drifting pace she was for several minutes exposed to a storm of shot and shell before replying with a single gun nelson coolly waited until he was within close range when the broadside he brought to bear worked fearful havoc on the enemys nearest ships therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset and prompt in his decision the word decision would have reference to the measurement of distance mentioned above letting the enemy get near before striking but i cannot help thinking that sun tzu meant to use the word in a figurative sense comparable to our own idiom short and sharp cf wang hsis note which after describing the falcons mode of attack proceeds this is just how the psychological moment should be seized in war energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow decision to the releasing of a trigger none of the commentators seem to grasp the real point of the simile of energy and the force stored up in the bent crossbow until released by the finger on the trigger amid the turmoil and tumult of battle there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all amid confusion and chaos your array may be without head or tail yet it will be proof against defeat mei yaochf en says the subdivisions of the army having been previously fixed and the various signals agreed upon the separating and joining the dispersing and collecting which will take place in the course of a battle may give the appearance of disorder when no real disorder is the an of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom possible your formation may be without head or tail your dispositions all topsyturvy and yet a rout of your forces quite out of the question simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline simulated fear postulates courage simulated weakness postulates strength in order to make the translation intelligible it is necessary to tone down the sharply paradoxical form of the original tsao kung throws out a hint of the meaning in his brief note these things all serve to destroy formation and conceal ones condition but tu mu is the first to put it quite plainly if you wish to feign confusion in order to lure the enemy on you must first have perfect discipline if you wish to display timidity in order to entrap the enemy you must have extreme courage if you wish to parade your weakness in order to make the enemy overconfident you must have exceeding strength hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision see supra ss concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy the commentators strongly understand a certain chinese word here differently than anywhere else in this chapter thus tu mu says seeing that we are favorably circumstanced and yet make no move the enemy will believe that we are really afraid masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions chang yu relates the following anecdote of kao tsu the first han emperor wishing to crush the hsiungnu he sent out spies to report on their condition but the hsiung nu forewarned carefully concealed all their ablebodied men and wellfed horses and only allowed infirm soldiers and emaciated cattle to be seen the result was that spies one and all recommended the emperor to deliver his attack lou ching alone opposed them saying when two countries go to war they are naturally inclined to make an ostentatious the art of wai by srni tzn the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom display of their strength yet our spies have seen nothing but old age and infirmity this is surely some ruse on the part of the enemy and it would be unwise for us to attack the emperor however disregarding this advice fell into the trap and found himself surrounded at poteng thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances according to which the enemy will act tsao kungs note is make a display of weakness and want tu mu says if our force happens to be superior to the enemys weakness may be simulated in order to lure him on but if inferior he must be led to believe that we are strong in order that he may keep off in fact all the enemys movements should be determined by the signs that we choose to give him note the following anecdote of sun pin a descendent of sun wu in bc the chfi state being at war with wei sent tien chi and sun pin against the general pang chuan who happened to be a deadly personal enemy of the later sun pin said the chfi state has a reputation for cowardice and therefore our adversary despises us let us turn this circumstance to account accordingly when the army had crossed the border into wei territory he gave orders to show fires on the first night on the next and the night after only pang chuan pursued them hotly saying to himself i knew these men of chfi were cowards their numbers have already fallen away by more than half in his retreat sun pin came to a narrow defile with he calculated that his pursuers would reach after dark here he had a tree stripped of its bark and inscribed upon it the words under this tree shall pang chuan die then as night began to fall he placed a strong body of archers in ambush near by with orders to shoot directly they saw a light later on pang chuan arrived at the spot and noticing the tree struck a light in order to read what was written on it his body was immediately riddled by a volley of arrows and his whole army thrown into confusion the above is tu mus version of the story the shih chi less dramatically but probably with more historical truth makes pang chuan cut his own throat with an exclamation of despair after the rout of his army the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom he sacrifices something that the enemy may snatch at it by holding out baits he keeps him on the march then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him with an emendation suggested by li ching this then reads he lies in wait with the main body of his troops the clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy and does not require too much from individuals tu mu says he first of all considers the power of his army in the bulk afterwards he takes individual talent into account and uses each men according to his capabilities he does not demand perfection from the untalented hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy when he utilizes combined energy his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones for it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground and to move when on a slope if fourcornered to come to a standstill but if roundshaped to go rolling down tsau kung calls this the use of natural or inherent power thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height so much on the subject of energy the chief lesson of this chapter in tu mus opinion is the paramount importance in war of rapid evolutions and sudden rushes great results he adds can thus be achieved with small forces fortyone years in india chapter the art of war by sun tzu g the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom vl weak points and strong chang yu attempts to explain the sequence of chapters as follows chapter iv on tactical dispositions treated of the offensive and the defensive chapter v on energy dealt with direct and indirect methods the good general acquaints himself first with the theory of attack and defense and then turns his attention to direct and indirect methods he studies the art of varying and combining these two methods before proceeding to the subject of weak and strong points for the use of direct or indirect methods arises out of attack and defense and the perception of weak and strong points depends again on the above methods hence the present chapter comes immediately after the chapter on energy sun tzu said whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy will be fresh for the fight whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy but does not allow the enemys will to be imposed on him one mark of a great soldier is that he fight on his own terms or fights not at all by holding out advantages to him he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord or by inflicting damage he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near in the first case he will entice him with a bait in the second he will strike at some important point which the enemy will have to defend if the enemy is taking his ease he can harass him this passage may be cited as evidence against mei yaochens interpretation of i ss if well supplied with food he can starve him out if quietly encamped he can force him to move the art of wai by srni tzu gs the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend march swiftly to places where you are not expected an army may march great distances without distress if it marches through country where the enemy is not tsao kung sums up very well emerge from the void qd like a bolt from the blue strike at vulnerable points shun places that are defended attack in unexpected quarters you can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended wang hsi explains undefended places as weak points that is to say where the general is lacking in capacity or the soldiers in spirit where the walls are not strong enough or the precautions not strict enough where relief comes too late or provisions are too scanty or the defenders are variance amongst themselves you can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked ie where there are none of the weak points mentioned above there is rather a nice point involved in the interpretation of this later clause tu mu chfen hao and mei yaochf en assume the meaning to be in order to make your defense quite safe you must defend even those places that are not likely to be attacked and tu mu adds how much more then those that will be attacked taken thus however the clause balances less well with the preceding â€” always a consideration in the highly antithetical style which is natural to the chinese chang yu therefore seems to come nearer the mark in saying he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven see iv ss making it impossible for the enemy to guard against him this being so the places that i shall attack are precisely those that the enemy cannot defend he who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth making it impossible for the enemy to estimate his whereabouts this being so the places that i shall hold are precisely those that the enemy cannot attack the an of war by son izu gg the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack an aphorism which puts the whole art of war in a nutshell o divine art of subtlety and secrecy through you we learn to be invisible through you inaudible literally without form or sound but it is said of course with reference to the enemy and hence we can hold the enemys fate in our hands you may advance and be absolutely irresistible if you make for the enemys weak points you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy if we wish to fight the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch all we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve tu mu says if the enemy is the invading party we can cut his line of communications and occupy the roads by which he will have to return if we are the invaders we may direct our attack against the sovereign himself it is clear that sun tzu unlike certain generals in the late boer war was no believer in frontal attacks if we do not wish to fight we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground all we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way this extremely concise expression is intelligibly paraphrased by chia lin even though we have constructed neither wall nor ditch li chfuan says we puzzle him by strange and unusual dispositions and tu mu finally the ait of wai by sim tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom clinches the meaning by three illustrative anecdotes â€” one of chuko liang who when occupying yangping and about to be attacked by ssuma i suddenly struck his colors stopped the beating of the drums and flung open the city gates showing only a few men engaged in sweeping and sprinkling the ground this unexpected proceeding had the intended effect for ssuma i suspecting an ambush actually drew off his army and retreated what sun tzu is advocating here therefore is nothing more nor less than the timely use of bluff by discovering the enemys dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves we can keep our forces concentrated while the enemys must be divided the conclusion is perhaps not very obvious but chang yu after mei yaochf en rightly explains it thus if the enemys dispositions are visible we can make for him in one body whereas our own dispositions being kept secret the enemy will be obliged to divide his forces in order to guard against attack from every quarter we can form a single united body while the enemy must split up into fractions hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole which means that we shall be many to the enemys few and if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one our opponents will be in dire straits the spot where we intend to fight must not be made known for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points sheridan once explained the reason of general grants victories by saying that while his opponents were kept fully employed wondering what he was going to do he was thinking most of what he was going to do himself the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom and his forces being thus distributed in many directions the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few for should the enemy strengthen his van he will weaken his rear should he strengthen his rear he will weaken his van should he strengthen his left he will weaken his right should he strengthen his right he will weaken his left if he sends reinforcements everywhere he will everywhere be weak in frederick the greats instructions to his generals we read a defensive war is apt to betray us into too frequent detachment those generals who have had but little experience attempt to protect every point while those who are better acquainted with their profession having only the capital object in view guard against a decisive blow and acquiesce in small misfortunes to avoid greater numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks numerical strength from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us the highest generalship in col hendersons words is to compel the enemy to disperse his army and then to concentrate superior force against each fraction in turn knowing the place and the time of the coming battle we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight what sun tzu evidently has in mind is that nice calculation of distances and that masterly employment of strategy which enable a general to divide his army for the purpose of a long and rapid march and afterwards to effect a junction at precisely the right spot and the right hour in order to confront the enemy in overwhelming strength among many such successful junctions which military history records one of the most dramatic and decisive was the appearance of blucher just at the critical moment on the field of waterloo the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom but if neither time nor place be known then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right the right equally impotent to succor the left the van unable to relieve the rear or the rear to support the van how much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred li apart and even the nearest are separated by several li the chinese of this last sentence is a little lacking in precision but the mental picture we are required to draw is probably that of an army advancing towards a given rendezvous in separate columns each of which has orders to be there on a fixed date if the general allows the various detachments to proceed at haphazard without precise instructions as to the time and place of meeting the enemy will be able to annihilate the army in detail chang yus note may be worth quoting here if we do not know the place where our opponents mean to concentrate or the day on which they will join battle our unity will be forfeited through our preparations for defense and the positions we hold will be insecure suddenly happening upon a powerful foe we shall be brought to battle in a flurried condition and no mutual support will be possible between wings vanguard or rear especially if there is any great distance between the foremost and hindmost divisions of the army though according to my estimate the soldiers of yueh exceed our own in number that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory i say then that victory can be achieved alas for these brave words the long feud between the two states ended in bc with the total defeat of wu by kou chien and its incorporation in yueh this was doubtless long after sun tzus death with his present assertion compare iv ss chang yu is the only one to point out the seeming discrepancy which he thus goes on to explain in the chapter on tactical dispositions it is said one may know how to conquer without being able to do it whereas here we have the statement that victory can be achieved the explanation is that in the former chapter where the offensive and defensive are under discussion it is said that if the enemy is fully prepared one cannot make certain of the art of wai by srni tzn the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom beating him but the present passage refers particularly to the soldiers of yueh who according to sun tzus calculations will be kept in ignorance of the time and place of the impending struggle that is why he says here that victory can be achieved though the enemy be stronger in numbers we may prevent him from fighting scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success an alternative reading offered by chia lin is know beforehand all plans conducive to our success and to the enemys failure rouse him and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity chang yu tells us that by noting the joy or anger shown by the enemy on being thus disturbed we shall be able to conclude whether his policy is to lie low or the reverse he instances the action of choku liang who sent the scornful present of a womans headdress to ssuma i in order to goad him out of his fabian tactics force him to reveal himself so as to find out his vulnerable spots carefully compare the opposing army with your own so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient cf iv ss in making tactical dispositions the highest pitch you can attain is to conceal them the piquancy of the paradox evaporates in translation concealment is perhaps not so much actual invisibility see supra ss as showing no sign of what you mean to do of the plans that are formed in your brain conceal your dispositions and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies from the machinations of the wisest brains the art of wai by sim izu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom tu mu explains though the enemy may have clever and capable officers they will not be able to lay any plans against us how victory may be produced for them out of the enemys own tactics â€” that is what the multitude cannot comprehend all men can see the tactics whereby i conquer but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved ie everybody can see superficially how a battle is won what they cannot see is the long series of plans and combinations which has preceded the battle do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances as wang hsi sagely remarks there is but one root principle underlying victory but the tactics which lead up to it are infinite in number with this compare col henderson the rules of strategy are few and simple they may be learned in a week they may be taught by familiar illustrations or a dozen diagrams but such knowledge will no more teach a man to lead an army like napoleon than a knowledge of grammar will teach him to write like gibbon military tactics are like unto water for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards so in war the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak like water taking the line of least resistance water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing therefore just as water retains no constant shape so in warfare there are no constant conditions the art of wai by sim izu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom he who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning may be called a heavenborn captain the five elements water fire wood metal earth are not always equally predominant that is as wang hsi says they predominate alternately the four seasons make way for each other in turn literally have no invariable seat there are short days and long the moon has its periods of waning and waxing cf v ss the purport of the passage is simply to illustrate the want of fixity in war by the changes constantly taking place in nature the comparison is not very happy however because the regularity of the phenomena which sun tzu mentions is by no means paralleled in war see col hendersons biography of stonewall jackson ed vol ii p the art of wai by smi tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom vii manewe ling sun tzu said in war the general receives his commands from the sovereign having collected an army and concentrated his forces he must blend and harmonize the different elements thereof before pitching his camp chang yu says the establishment of harmony and confidence between the higher and lower ranks before venturing into the field and he quotes a saying of wu tzu chap ad init without harmony in the state no military expedition can be undertaken without harmony in the army no battle array can be formed in an historical romance sun tzu is represented as saying to wu yuan as a general rule those who are waging war should get rid of all the domestic troubles before proceeding to attack the external foe after that comes tactical maneuvering than which there is nothing more difficult i have departed slightly from the traditional interpretation of tsao kung who says from the time of receiving the sovereigns instructions until our encampment over against the enemy the tactics to be pursued are most difficult it seems to me that the tactics or maneuvers can hardly be said to begin until the army has sallied forth and encamped and chfien haos note gives color to this view for levying concentrating harmonizing and entrenching an army there are plenty of old rules which will serve the real difficulty comes when we engage in tactical operations tu yu also observes that the great difficulty is to be beforehand with the enemy in seizing favorable position the difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct and misfortune into gain this sentence contains one of those highly condensed and somewhat enigmatical expressions of which sun tzu is so fond this is how it is explained by tsao kung make it appear that you are a long way off then cover the distance the art of wai by sim tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom rapidly and arrive on the scene before your opponent tu mu says hoodwink the enemy so that he may be remiss and leisurely while you are dashing along with utmost speed ho shih gives a slightly different turn although you may have difficult ground to traverse and natural obstacles to encounter this is a drawback which can be turned into actual advantage by celerity of movement signal examples of this saying are afforded by the two famous passages across the alps â€” that of hannibal which laid italy at his mercy and that of napoleon two thousand years later which resulted in the great victory of marengo thus to take a long and circuitous route after enticing the enemy out of the way and though starting after him to contrive to reach the goal before him shows knowledge of the artifice of deviation tu mu cites the famous march of chao she in bc to relieve the town of oyu which was closely invested by a chun army the king of chao first consulted lien p x o on the advisability of attempting a relief but the latter thought the distance too great and the intervening country too rugged and difficult his majesty then turned to chao she who fully admitted the hazardous nature of the march but finally said we shall be like two rats fighting in a whole â€” and the pluckier one will win so he left the capital with his army but had only gone a distance of li when he stopped and began throwing up entrenchments for days he continued strengthening his fortifications and took care that spies should carry the intelligence to the enemy the chun general was overjoyed and attributed his adversarys tardiness to the fact that the beleaguered city was in the han state and thus not actually part of chao territory but the spies had no sooner departed than chao she began a forced march lasting for two days and one night and arrive on the scene of action with such astonishing rapidity that he was able to occupy a commanding position on the north hill before the enemy had got wind of his movements a crushing defeat followed for the chun forces who were obliged to raise the siege of oyu in all haste and retreat across the border the art of wai by sim izu s the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom maneuvering with an army is advantageous with an undisciplined multitude most dangerous i adopt the reading of the tung tien cheng yuhsien and the tu shu since they appear to apply the exact nuance required in order to make sense the commentators using the standard text take this line to mean that maneuvers may be profitable or they may be dangerous it all depends on the ability of the general if you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage the chances are that you will be too late on the other hand to detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage and stores some of the chinese text is unintelligible to the chinese commentators who paraphrase the sentence i submit my own rendering without much enthusiasm being convinced that there is some deepseated corruption in the text on the whole it is clear that sun tzu does not approve of a lengthy march being undertaken without supplies cf infra ss thus if you order your men to roll up their buffcoats and make forced marches without halting day or night covering double the usual distance at a stretch the ordinary days march according to tu mu was li but on one occasion when pursuing liu pei tsao tsao is said to have covered the incredible distance of li within twentyfour hours doing a hundred li in order to wrest an advantage the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy the stronger men will be in front the jaded ones will fall behind and on this plan only onetenth of your army will reach its destination the moral is as tsao kung and others point out dont march a hundred li to gain a tactical advantage either with or without impedimenta maneuvers of this description should be confined to short distances stonewall jackson the art of wai by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom said the hardships of forced marches are often more painful than the dangers of battle he did not often call upon his troops for extraordinary exertions it was only when he intended a surprise or when a rapid retreat was imperative that he sacrificed everything for speed if you march fifty li in order to outmaneuver the enemy you will lose the leader of your first division and only half your force will reach the goal literally the leader of the first division will be torn away if you march thirty li with the same object two thirds of your army will arrive in the tung tien is added from this we may know the difficulty of maneuvering we may take it then that an army without its baggagetrain is lost without provisions it is lost without bases of supply it is lost i think sun tzu meant stores accumulated in depots but tu yu says fodder and the like chang yu says goods in general and wang hsi says fuel salt foodstuffs etc we cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors we are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country â€” its mountains and forests its pitfalls and precipices its marshes and swamps we shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account unless we make use of local guides ss are repeated in chap xi ss in war practice dissimulation and you will succeed in the tactics of turenne deception of the enemy especially as to the numerical strength of his troops took a very prominent position the art of wax by sim tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom whether to concentrate or to divide your troops must be decided by circumstances let your rapidity be that of the wind the simile is doubly appropriate because the wind is not only swift but as mei yaochf en points out invisible and leaves no tracks your compactness that of the forest meng shih comes nearer to the mark in his note when slowly marching order and ranks must be preserved â€” so as to guard against surprise attacks but natural forest do not grow in rows whereas they do generally possess the quality of density or compactness in raiding and plundering be like fire cf shih ching iv iv fierce as a blazing fire which no man can check is immovability like a mountain that is when holding a position from which the enemy is trying to dislodge you or perhaps as tu yu says when he is trying to entice you into a trap let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night and when you move fall like a thunderbolt tu yu quotes a saying of tai kung which has passed into a proverb you cannot shut your ears to the thunder or your eyes to the lighting â€” so rapid are they likewise an attack should be made so quickly that it cannot be parried when you plunder a countryside let the spoil be divided amongst your men sun tzu wishes to lessen the abuses of indiscriminate plundering by insisting that all booty shall be thrown into a common stock which may afterwards be fairly divided amongst all when you capture new territory cut it up into allotments for the benefit of the soldiery chfen hao says quarter your soldiers on the land and let them sow and plant it it is by acting on this principle the art of wai by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom and harvesting the lands they invaded that the chinese have succeeded in carrying out some of their most memorable and triumphant expeditions such as that of pan chfao who penetrated to the caspian and in more recent years those of fuk x angan and tso tsungf ang ponder and deliberate before you make a move chang yu quotes wei liao tzu as saying that we must not break camp until we have gained the resisting power of the enemy and the cleverness of the opposing general cf the seven comparisons in i ss he will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation see supra ss such is the art of maneuvering with these words the chapter would naturally come to an end but there now follows a long appendix in the shape of an extract from an earlier book on war now lost but apparently extant at the time when sun tzu wrote the style of this fragment is not noticeable different from that of sun tzu himself but no commentator raises a doubt as to its genuineness the book of army management says it is perhaps significant that none of the earlier commentators give us any information about this work mei yaochfen calls it an ancient military classic and wang hsi an old book on war considering the enormous amount of fighting that had gone on for centuries before sun tzus time between the various kingdoms and principalities of china it is not in itself improbable that a collection of military maxims should have been made and written down at some earlier period on the field of battle implied though not actually in the chinese the spoken word does not carry far enough hence the institution of gongs and drums nor can ordinary the art of wai by srni tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom objects be seen clearly enough hence the institution of banners and flags gongs and drums banners and flags are means whereby the ears and eyes of the host may be focused on one particular point chang yu says if sight and hearing converge simultaneously on the same object the evolutions of as many as a million soldiers will be like those of a single man the host thus forming a single united body is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone or for the cowardly to retreat alone chuang yu quotes a saying equally guilty are those who advance against orders and those who retreat against orders tu mu tells a story in this connection of wu chfi when he was fighting against the chun state before the battle had begun one of his soldiers a man of matchless daring sallied forth by himself captured two heads from the enemy and returned to camp wu chfi had the man instantly executed whereupon an officer ventured to remonstrate saying this man was a good soldier and ought not to have been beheaded wu chfi replied i fully believe he was a good soldier but i had him beheaded because he acted without orders this is the art of handling large masses of men in nightfighting then make much use of signal fires and drums and in fighting by day of flags and banners as a means of influencing the ears and eyes of your army chf en hao alludes to li kuangpis night ride to ho yang at the head of mounted men they made such an imposing display with torches that though the rebel leader shih ssuming had a large army he did not dare to dispute their passage a whole army may be robbed of its spirit in war says chang yu if a spirit of anger can be made to pervade all ranks of an army at one and the same the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom time its onset will be irresistible now the spirit of the enemys soldiers will be keenest when they have newly arrived on the scene and it is therefore our cue not to fight at once but to wait until their ardor and enthusiasm have worn off and then strike it is in this way that they may be robbed of their keen spirit li chfuan and others tell an anecdote to be found in the tso chuan year ss of tsao kuei a protege of duke chuang of lu the latter state was attacked by chfi and the duke was about to join battle at chf angcho after the first roll of the enemys drums when tsao said not just yet only after their drums had beaten for the third time did he give the word for attack then they fought and the men of chfi were utterly defeated questioned afterwards by the duke as to the meaning of his delay tsao kuei replied in battle a courageous spirit is everything now the first roll of the drum tends to create this spirit but with the second it is already on the wane and after the third it is gone altogether i attacked when their spirit was gone and ours was at its height hence our victory wu tzu chap puts spirit first among the four important influences in war and continues the value of a whole army â€” a mighty host of a million men â€” is dependent on one man alone such is the influence of spirit a commanderinchief may be robbed of his presence of mind chang yu says presence of mind is the generals most important asset it is the quality which enables him to discipline disorder and to inspire courage into the panic stricken the great general li ching ad has a saying attacking does not merely consist in assaulting walled cities or striking at an army in battle array it must include the art of assailing the enemys mental equilibrium now a soliders spirit is keenest in the morning always provided i suppose that he has had breakfast at the battle of the trebia the romans were foolishly allowed to fight fasting whereas hannibals men had breakfasted at their leisure see livy xxi liv iv and by noonday it has begun to flag and in the evening his mind is bent only on returning to camp the an of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom a clever general therefore avoids an army when its spirit is keen but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return this is the art of studying moods disciplined and calm to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy â€” this is the art of retaining selfpossession to be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling to be wellfed while the enemy is famished â€” this is the art of husbanding ones strength to refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident array this is the art of studying circumstances it is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy nor to oppose him when he comes downhill do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen do not swallow bait offered by the enemy li crf uan and tu mu with extraordinary inability to see a metaphor take these words quite literally of food and drink that have been poisoned by the enemy chfen hao and chang yu carefully point out that the saying has a wider application do not interfere with an army that is returning home the commentators explain this rather singular piece of advice by saying that a man whose heart is set on returning home will fight to the death against any attempt to bar his way and is therefore too dangerous an opponent to be tackled chang yu quotes the words of han hsin invincible is the soldier who hath his desire and returneth homewards a marvelous tale is told of tsao tsaos courage and resource in ch of the san kuo chi in ad he was besieging chang hsiu in jang when liu piao sent the ait of wai by smi tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom reinforcements with a view to cutting off tsaos retreat the latter was obligbed to draw off his troops only to find himself hemmed in between two enemies who were guarding each outlet of a narrow pass in which he had engaged himself in this desperate plight tsao waited until nightfall when he bored a tunnel into the mountain side and laid an ambush in it as soon as the whole army had passed by the hidden troops fell on his rear while tsao himself turned and met his pursuers in front so that they were thrown into confusion and annihilated tsao tsao said afterwards the brigands tried to check my army in its retreat and brought me to battle in a desperate position hence i knew how to overcome them when you surround an army leave an outlet free this does not mean that the enemy is to be allowed to escape the object as tu mu puts it is to make him believe that there is a road to safety and thus prevent his fighting with the courage of despair tu mu adds pleasantly after that you may crush him do not press a desperate foe too hard chfen hao quotes the saying birds and beasts when brought to bay will use their claws and teeth chang yu says if your adversary has burned his boats and destroyed his cookingpots and is ready to stake all on the issue of a battle he must not be pushed to extremities ho shih illustrates the meaning by a story taken from the life of yen chfing that general together with his colleague tu chung wei was surrounded by a vastly superior army of khitans in the year ad the country was bare and desertlike and the little chinese force was soon in dire straits for want of water the wells they bored ran dry and the men were reduced to squeezing lumps of mud and sucking out the moisture their ranks thinned rapidly until at last fu yen chfing exclaimed we are desperate men far better to die for our country than to go with fettered hands into captivity a strong gale happened to be blowing from the northeast and darkening the air with dense clouds of sandy dust to chungwei was for waiting until this had abated before deciding on a final attack but luckily another officer li shoucheng by name was quicker to see an opportunity and said they are many and we are few but in the midst of the an of war by son izu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom this sandstorm our numbers will not be discernible victory will go to the strenuous fighter and the wind will be our best ally accordingly fu yenchung made a sudden and wholly unexpected onslaught with his cavalry routed the barbarians and succeeded in breaking through to safety such is the art of warfare see col henderson op cit vol i p for a number of maxims on this head see marshal turenne longmans p the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom viil variations in tactics the heading means literally the nine variations but as sun tzu does not appear to enumerate these and as indeed he has already told us v ss that such deflections from the ordinary course are practically innumerable we have little option but to follow wang hsi who says that nine stands for an indefinitely large number all it means is that in warfare we ought to very our tactics to the utmost degreel do not know what tsao kung makes these nine variations out to be but it has been suggested that they are connected with the nine situations of chapt xi this is the view adopted by chang yu the only other alternative is to suppose that something has been lost â€” a supposition to which the unusual shortness of the chapter lends some weight sun tzu said in war the general receives his commands from the sovereign collects his army and concentrates his forces repeated from vii ss where it is certainly more in place it may have been interpolated here merely in order to supply a beginning to the chapter when in difficult country do not encamp in country where high roads intersect join hands with your allies do not linger in dangerously isolated positions the last situation is not one of the nine situations as given in the beginning of chap xi but occurs later on ibid ss qv chang yu defines this situation as being situated across the frontier in hostile territory li chfuan says it is country in which there are no springs or wells flocks or herds vegetables or firewood chia lin one of gorges chasms and precipices without a road by which to advance in hemmedin situations you must resort to stratagem in desperate position you must fight there are roads which must not be followed the art of wai by sun tzu ss the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom especially those leading through narrow defiles says li chfuan where an ambush is to be feared armies which must be not attacked more correctly perhaps there are times when an army must not be attacked chf en hao says when you see your way to obtain a rival advantage but are powerless to inflict a real defeat refrain from attacking for fear of overtaxing your mens strength towns which must not be besieged cf iii ss tsao kung gives an interesting illustration from his own experience when invading the territory of hsu chou he ignored the city of huapi which lay directly in his path and pressed on into the heart of the country this excellent strategy was rewarded by the subsequent capture of no fewer than fourteen important district cities chang yu says no town should be attacked which if taken cannot be held or if left alone will not cause any trouble hsun ying when urged to attack piyang replied the city is small and wellfortified even if i succeed intaking it it will be no great feat of arms whereas if i fail i shall make myself a laughingstock in the seventeenth century sieges still formed a large proportion of war it was turenne who directed attention to the importance of marches countermarches and maneuvers he said it is a great mistake to waste men in taking a town when the same expenditure of soldiers will gain a province positions which must not be contested commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed this is a hard saying for the chinese with their reverence for authority and wei liao tzu quoted by tu mu is moved to exclaim weapons are baleful instruments strife is antagonistic to virtue a military commander is the negation of civil order the unpalatable fact remains however that even imperial wishes must be subordinated to military necessity the general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom the general who does not understand these may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account literally get the advantage of the ground which means not only securing good positions but availing oneself of natural advantages in every possible way chang yu says every kind of ground is characterized by certain natural features and also gives scope for a certain variability of plan how it is possible to turn these natural features to account unless topographical knowledge is supplemented by versatility of mind so the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans even though he be acquainted with the five advantages will fail to make the best use of his men chia lin tells us that these imply five obvious and generally advantageous lines of action namely if a certain road is short it must be followed if an army is isolated it must be attacked if a town is in a parlous condition it must be besieged if a position can be stormed it must be attempted and if consistent with military operations the rulers commands must be obeyed but there are circumstances which sometimes forbid a general to use these advantages for instance a certain road may be the shortest way for him but if he knows that it abounds in natural obstacles or that the enemy has laid an ambush on it he will not follow that road a hostile force may be open to attack but if he knows that it is hardpressed and likely to fight with desperation he will refrain from striking and so on hence in the wise leaders plans considerations of advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together whether in an advantageous position or a disadvantageous one says tsao kung the opposite state should be always present to your mind the art of wai by srni tzn the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom if our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way we may succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes tu mu says if we wish to wrest an advantage from the enemy we must not fix our minds on that alone but allow for the possibility of the enemy also doing some harm to us and let this enter as a factor into our calculations if on the other hand in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage we may extricate ourselves from misfortune tu mu says if i wish to extricate myself from a dangerous position i must consider not only the enemys ability to injure me but also my own ability to gain an advantage over the enemy if in my counsels these two considerations are properly blended i shall succeed in liberating myselffor instance if i am surrounded by the enemy and only think of effecting an escape the nervelessness of my policy will incite my adversary to pursue and crush me it would be far better to encourage my men to deliver a bold counterattack and use the advantage thus gained to free myself from the enemys toils see the story of tsao tsao vii ss note reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them chia lin enumerates several ways of inflicting this injury some of which would only occur to the oriental mind â€” entice away the enemys best and wisest men so that he may be left without counselors introduce traitors into his country that the government policy may be rendered futile foment intrigue and deceit and thus sow dissension between the ruler and his ministers by means of every artful contrivance cause deterioration amongst his men and waste of his treasure corrupt his morals by insidious gifts leading him into excess disturb and unsettle his mind by presenting him with lovely women chang yu after wang hsi makes a different interpretation of sun tzu here get the enemy into a position where he must suffer injury and he will submit of his own accord and make trouble for them the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom tu mu in this phrase in his interpretation indicates that trouble should be make for the enemy affecting their possessions or as we might say assets which he considers to be a large army a rich exchequer harmony amongst the soldiers punctual fulfillment of commands these give us a whiphand over the enemy and keep them constantly engaged literally make servants of them tu yu says prevent the from having any rest hold out specious allurements and make them rush to any given point meng shihs note contains an excellent example of the idiomatic use of cause them to forget pien the reasons for acting otherwise than on their first impulse and hasten in our direction the art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemys not coming but on our own readiness to receive him not on the chance of his not attacking but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable there are five dangerous faults which may affect a general recklessness which leads to destruction bravery without forethought as tsao kung analyzes it which causes a man to fight blindly and desperately like a mad bull such an opponent says chang yu must not be encountered with brute force but may be lured into an ambush and slain cf wu tzu chap iv ad init in estimating the character of a general men are wont to pay exclusive attention to his courage forgetting that courage is only one out of many qualities which a general should possess the merely brave man is prone to fight recklessly and he who fights recklessly without any perception of what is expedient must be condemned ssuma fa too make the incisive remark simply going to ones death does not bring about victory cowardice which leads to capture the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom tsao kung defines the chinese word translated here as cowardice as being of the man whom timidity prevents from advancing to seize an advantage and wang hsi adds who is quick to flee at the sight of danger meng shih gives the closer paraphrase he who is bent on returning alive this is the man who will never take a risk but as sun tzu knew nothing is to be achieved in war unless you are willing to take risks tai kung said he who lets an advantage slip will subsequently bring upon himself real disaster in ad liu yu pursued the rebel huan hsuan up the yangtsze and fought a naval battle with him at the island of chfeng hung the loyal troops numbered only a few thousands while their opponents were in great force but huan hsuan fearing the fate which was in store for him should be be overcome had a light boat made fast to the side of his war junk so that he might escape if necessary at a moments notice the natural result was that the fighting spirit of his soldiers was utterly quenched and when the loyalists made an attack from windward with fireships all striving with the utmost ardor to be first in the fray huan hsuans forces were routed had to burn all their baggage and fled for two days and nights without stopping chang yu tells a somewhat similar story of chao yingchfi a general of the chin state who during a battle with the army of chfu in bc had a boat kept in readiness for him on the river wishing in case of defeat to be the first to get across a hasty temper which can be provoked by insults tu mu tells us that yao hsing when opposed in ad by huang mei teng chfiang and others shut himself up behind his walls and refused to fight teng chfiang said our adversary is of a choleric temper and easily provoked let us make constant sallies and break down his walls then he will grow angry and come out once we can bring his force to battle it is doomed to be our prey this plan was acted upon yao hsiang came out to fight was lured as far as sanyuan by the enemys pretended flight and finally attacked and slain a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom this need not be taken to mean that a sense of honor is really a defect in a general what sun tzu condemns is rather an exaggerated sensitiveness to slanderous reports the thinskinned man who is stung by opprobrium however undeserved mei yaochfen truly observes though somewhat paradoxically the seek after glory should be careless of public opinion oversolicitude for his men which exposes him to worry and trouble here again sun tzu does not mean that the general is to be careless of the welfare of his troops all he wishes to emphasize is the danger of sacrificing any important military advantage to the immediate comfort of his men this is a shortsighted policy because in the long run the troops will suffer more from the defeat or at best the prolongation of the war which will be the consequence a mistaken feeling of pity will often induce a general to relieve a beleaguered city or to reinforce a hardpressed detachment contrary to his military instincts it is now generally admitted that our repeated efforts to relieve ladysmith in the south african war were so many strategical blunders which defeated their own purpose and in the end relief came through the very man who started out with the distinct resolve no longer to subordinate the interests of the whole to sentiment in favor of a part an old soldier of one of our generals who failed most conspicuously in this war tried once i remember to defend him to me on the ground that he was always so good to his men by this plea had he but known it he was only condemning him out of sun tzus mouth these are the five besetting sins of a general ruinous to the conduct of war when an army is overthrown and its leader slain the cause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults let them be a subject of meditation marshal turenne p the an of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom ix the army on the march the contents of this interesting chapter are better indicated in ss than by this heading sun tzu said we come now to the question of encamping the army and observing signs of the enemy pass quickly over mountains and keep in the neighborhood of valleys the idea is not to linger among barren uplands but to keep close to supplies of water and grass cf wu tzu ch abide not in natural ovens ie the openings of valleys chang yu tells the following anecdote wutu chfiang was a robber captain in the time of the later han and ma yuan was sent to exterminate his gang chfiang having found a refuge in the hills ma yuan made no attempt to force a battle but seized all the favorable positions commanding supplies of water and forage chfiang was soon in such a desperate plight for want of provisions that he was forced to make a total surrender he did not know the advantage of keeping in the neighborhood of valleys camp in high places not on high hills but on knolls or hillocks elevated above the surrounding country facing the sun tu mu takes this to mean facing south and chf en hao facing east cf infra ss do not climb heights in order to fight so much for mountain warfare after crossing a river you should get far away from it in order to tempt the enemy to cross after you according to tsao kung and also says chang yu in order not to be impeded in your evolutions the tung tien reads if the enemy crosses a river etc but in view of the next sentence this is almost certainly an interpolation the art of wai by srni tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom when an invading force crosses a river in its onward march do not advance to meet it in midstream it will be best to let half the army get across and then deliver your attack li chfuan alludes to the great victory won by han hsin over lung chu at the wei river turning to the citien han shu ch fol verso we find the battle described as follows the two armies were drawn up on opposite sides of the river in the night han hsin ordered his men to take some ten thousand sacks filled with sand and construct a dam higher up then leading half his army across he attacked lung chu but after a time pretending to have failed in his attempt he hastily withdrew to the other bank lung chu was much elated by this unlookedfor success and exclaiming i felt sure that han hsin was really a coward he pursued him and began crossing the river in his turn han hsin now sent a party to cut open the sandbags thus releasing a great volume of water which swept down and prevented the greater portion of lung chus army from getting across he then turned upon the force which had been cut off and annihilated it lung chu himself being amongst the slain the rest of the army on the further bank also scattered and fled in all directions if you are anxious to fight you should not go to meet the invader near a river which he has to cross for fear of preventing his crossing moor your craft higher up than the enemy and facing the sun see supra ss the repetition of these words in connection with water is very awkward chang yu has the note said either of troops marshaled on the riverbank or of boats anchored in the stream itself in either case it is essential to be higher than the enemy and facing the sun the other commentators are not at all explicit do not move upstream to meet the enemy tu mu says as water flows downwards we must not pitch our camp on the lower reaches of a river for fear the enemy should open the sluices and sweep us away in a the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom flood chuko wuhou has remarked that in river warfare we must not advance against the stream which is as much as to say that our fleet must not be anchored below that of the enemy for then they would be able to take advantage of the current and make short work of us there is also the danger noted by other commentators that the enemy may throw poison on the water to be carried down to us so much for river warfare in crossing saltmarshes your sole concern should be to get over them quickly without any delay because of the lack of fresh water the poor quality of the herbage and last but not least because they are low flat and exposed to attack if forced to fight in a saltmarsh you should have water and grass near you and get your back to a clump of trees li chfuan remarks that the ground is less likely to be treacherous where there are trees while tu mu says that they will serve to protect the rear so much for operations in saltmarches in dry level country take up an easily accessible position with rising ground to your right and on your rear tu mu quotes tai kung as saying an army should have a stream or a marsh on its left and a hill or tumulus on its right so that the danger may be in front and safety lie behind so much for campaigning in flat country these are the four useful branches of military knowledge those namely concerned with mountains rivers marshes and plains compare napoleons military maxims no which enabled the yellow emperor to vanquish four several sovereigns the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom regarding the yellow emperor mei yaochf en asks with some plausibility whether there is an error in the text as nothing is known of huang ti having conquered four other emperors the shih chi ch ad init speaks only of his victories over yen ti and chfih yu in the liu t x ao it is mentioned that he fought seventy battles and pacified the empire tsao kungs explanation is that the yellow emperor was the first to institute the feudal system of vassals princes each of whom to the number of four originally bore the title of emperor li chfuan tells us that the art of war originated under huang ti who received it from his minister feng hou all armies prefer high ground to low high ground says mei yaochfen is not only more agreement and salubrious but more convenient from a military point of view low ground is not only damp and unhealthy but also disadvantageous for fighting and sunny places to dark if you are careful of your men tsao kung says make for fresh water and pasture where you can turn out your animals to graze and camp on hard ground the army will be free from disease of every kind chang yu says the dryness of the climate will prevent the outbreak of illness and this will spell victory when you come to a hill or a bank occupy the sunny side with the slope on your right rear thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers and utilize the natural advantages of the ground when in consequence of heavy rains upcountry a river which you wish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam you must wait until it subsides country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running between deep natural hollows the art of wai by srni tzn the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom the latter defined as places enclosed on every side by steep banks with pools of water at the bottom confined places defined as natural pens or prisons or places surrounded by precipices on three sides â€” easy to get into but hard to get out of tangled thickets defined as places covered with such dense undergrowth that spears cannot be used quagmires defined as lowlying places so heavy with mud as to be impassable for chariots and horsemen and crevasses defined by mei yaochfen as a narrow difficult way between beetling cliffs tu mus note is ground covered with trees and rocks and intersected by numerous ravines and pitfalls this is very vague but chia lin explains it clearly enough as a defile or narrow pass and chang yu takes much the same view on the whole the weight of the commentators certainly inclines to the rendering defile but the ordinary meaning of the chinese in one place is a crack or fissure and the fact that the meaning of the chinese elsewhere in the sentence indicates something in the nature of a defile make me think that sun tzu is here speaking of crevasses should be left with all possible speed and not approached while we keep away from such places we should get the enemy to approach them while we face them we should let the enemy have them on his rear if in the neighborhood of your camp there should be any hilly country ponds surrounded by aquatic grass hollow basins filled with reeds or woods with thick undergrowth they must be carefully routed out the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom and searched for these are places where men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be lurking chang yu has the note we must also be on our guard against traitors who may lie in close covert secretly spying out our weaknesses and overhearing our instructions when the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet he is relying on the natural strength of his position here begin sun tzus remarks on the reading of signs much of which is so good that it could almost be included in a modern manual like gen badenpowells aids to scouting when he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle he is anxious for the other side to advance probably because we are in a strong position from which he wishes to dislodge us if he came close up to us says tu mu and tried to force a battle he would seem to despise us and there would be less probability of our responding to the challenge if his place of encampment is easy of access he is tendering a bait movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is advancing tsao kung explains this as felling trees to clear a passage and chang yu says every man sends out scouts to climb high places and observe the enemy if a scout sees that the trees of a forest are moving and shaking he may know that they are being cut down to clear a passage for the enemys march the appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass means that the enemy wants to make us suspicious tu yus explanation borrowed from tsao kungs is as follows the presence of a number of screens or sheds in the midst of thick vegetation is a sure sign that the enemy has fled and fearing pursuit has constructed these hiding places in order to make us suspect an ambush it appears the art of wai by srni tzn the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom that these screens were hastily knotted together out of any long grass which the retreating enemy happened to come across the rising of birds in theirflight is the sign of an ambuscade chang yus explanation is doubtless right when birds that are flying along in a straight line suddenly shoot upwards it means that soldiers are in ambush at the spot beneath startled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming when there is dust rising in a high column it is the sign of chariots advancing when the dust is low but spread over a wide area it betokens the approach of infantry high and sharp or rising to a peak is of course somewhat exaggerated as applied to dust the commentators explain the phenomenon by saying that horses and chariots being heavier than men raise more dust and also follow one another in the same wheeltrack whereas footsoldiers would be marching in ranks many abreast according to chang yu every army on the march must have scouts some way in advance who on sighting dust raised by the enemy will gallop back and report it to the commanderinchief cf gen badenpowell as you move along say in a hostile country your eyes should be looking afar for the enemy or any signs of him figures dust rising birds getting up glitter of arms etc when it branches out in different directions it shows that parties have been sent to collect firewood a few clouds of dust moving to and fro signify that the army is encamping chang yu says in apportioning the defenses for a cantonment light horse will be sent out to survey the position and ascertain the weak and strong points all along its circumference hence the small quantity of dust and its motion the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance as though they stood in great fear of us says tu mu their object is to make us contemptuous and careless after which they will attack us chang yu alludes to the story of tien tan of the chf imo against the yen forces led by chfi chieh in ch of the shih chi we read tien tan openly said my only fear is that the yen army may cut off the noses of their chfi prisoners and place them in the front rank to fight against us that would be the undoing of our city the other side being informed of this speech at once acted on the suggestion but those within the city were enraged at seeing their fellowcountrymen thus mutilated and fearing only lest they should fall into the enemys hands were nerved to defend themselves more obstinately than ever once again tien tan sent back converted spies who reported these words to the enemy what i dread most is that the men of yen may dig up the ancestral tombs outside the town and by inflicting this indignity on our forefathers cause us to become fainthearted forthwith the besiegers dug up all the graves and burned the corpses lying in them and the inhabitants of chimo witnessing the outrage from the citywalls wept passionately and were all impatient to go out and fight their fury being increased tenfold tien tan knew then that his soldiers were ready for any enterprise but instead of a sword he himself too a mattock in his hands and ordered others to be distributed amongst his best warriors while the ranks were filled up with their wives and concubines he then served out all the remaining rations and bade his men eat their fill the regular soldiers were told to keep out of sight and the walls were manned with the old and weaker men and with women this done envoys were dispatched to the enemys camp to arrange terms of surrender whereupon the yen army began shouting for joy fien tan also collected ounces of silver from the people and got the wealthy citizens of chimo to send it to the yen general with the prayer that when the town capitulated he would allow their homes to be plundered or their women to be maltreated chfi chieh in high good humor granted their prayer but his army now became increasingly slack and careless meanwhile tien tan got together a thousand oxen decked them with pieces of red the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom silk painted their bodies dragonlike with colored stripes and fastened sharp blades on their horns and wellgreased rushes on their tails when night came on he lighted the ends of the rushes and drove the oxen through a number of holes which he had pierced in the walls backing them up with a force of picked warriors the animals maddened with pain dashed furiously into the enemys camp where they caused the utmost confusion and dismay for their tails acted as torches showing up the hideous pattern on their bodies and the weapons on their horns killed or wounded any with whom they came into contact in the meantime the band of had crept up with gags in their mouths and now threw themselves on the enemy at the same moment a frightful din arose in the city itself all those that remained behind making as much noise as possible by banging drums and hammering on bronze vessels until heaven and earth were convulsed by the uproar terrorstricken the yen army fled in disorder hotly pursued by the men of chfi who succeeded in slaying their general chfi chienthe result of the battle was the ultimate recovery of some seventy cities which had belonged to the chfi state violent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that he will retreat when the light chariots come out first and take up a position on the wings it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot the reading here is uncertain li chf uan indicates a treaty confirmed by oaths and hostages wang hsi and chang yu on the other hand simply say without reason on a frivolous pretext when there is much running about every man hastening to his proper place under his own regimental banner and the soldiers fall into rank it means that the critical moment has come the art of war by srm tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom when some are seen advancing and some retreating it is a lure when the soldiers stand leaning on their spears they are faint from want of food if those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves the army is suffering from thirst as tu mu remarks one may know the condition of a whole army from the behavior of a single man if the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to secure it the soldiers are exhausted if birds gather on any spot it is unoccupied a useful fact to bear in mind when for instance as chfen hao says the enemy has secretly abandoned his camp clamor by night betokens nervousness if there is disturbance in the camp the generals authority is weak if the banners and flags are shifted about sedition is afoot if the officers are angry it means that the men are weary tu mu understands the sentence differently if all the officers of an army are angry with their general it means that they are broken with fatigue owing to the exertions which he has demanded from them when an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food in the ordinary course of things the men would be fed on grain and the horses chiefly on grass and when the men do not hang their cookingpots over the campfires showing that they will not return to their tents you may know that they are determined to fight to the death the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom i may quote here the illustrative passage from the hou han shu ch given in abbreviated form by the p x ei wen yun fu the rebel wang kuo of liang was besieging the town of chfentsang and huangfu sung who was in supreme command and tung cho were sent out against him the latter pressed for hasty measures but sung turned a deaf ear to his counsel at last the rebels were utterly worn out and began to throw down their weapons of their own accord sung was not advancing to the attack but cho said it is a principle of war not to pursue desperate men and not to press a retreating host sung answered that does not apply here what i am about to attack is a jaded army not a retreating host with disciplined troops i am falling on a disorganized multitude not a band of desperate men thereupon he advances to the attack unsupported by his colleague and routed the enemy wang kuo being slain the sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in subdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his resources because when an army is hard pressed as tu mu says there is always a fear of mutiny and lavish rewards are given to keep the men in good temper too many punishments betray a condition of dire distress because in such case discipline becomes relaxed and unwonted severity is necessary to keep the men to their duty to begin by bluster but afterwards to take fright at the enemys numbers shows a supreme lack of intelligence i follow the interpretation of tsao kung also adopted by li chf uan tu mu and chang yu another possible meaning set forth by tu yu chia lin mei taochfen and wang hsi is the general who is first tyrannical towards his men and then in terror lest they should mutiny etc this the art of wax by sxm tzn the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom would connect the sentence with what went before about rewards and punishments when envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce tu mu says if the enemy open friendly relations be sending hostages it is a sign that they are anxious for an armistice either because their strength is exhausted or for some other reason but it hardly needs a sun tzu to draw such an obvious inference if the enemys troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a long time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again the situation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection tsao kung says a maneuver of this sort may be only a ruse to gain time for an unexpected flank attack or the laying of an ambush if our troops are no more in number than the enemy that is amply sufficient it only means that no direct attack can be made literally no martial advance that is to say cheng tactics and frontal attacks must be eschewed and stratagem resorted to instead what we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength keep a close watch on the enemy and obtain reinforcements this is an obscure sentence and none of the commentators succeed in squeezing very good sense out of it i follow li chfuan who appears to offer the simplest explanation only the side that gets more men will win fortunately we have chang yu to expound its meaning to us in language which is lucidity itself when the numbers are even and no favorable opening presents itself although we may not be strong enough to deliver a sustained attack we can find additional recruits amongst our sutlers and camp followers and then concentrating our forces and keeping a the art of war by srm tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom close watch on the enemy contrive to snatch the victory but we must avoid borrowing foreign soldiers to help us he then quotes from wei liao tzu ch the nominal strength of mercenary troops may be but their real value will be not more than half that figure he who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them civ en hao quoting from the tso chuan says if bees and scorpions carry poison how much more will a hostile state even a puny opponent then should not be treated with contempt if soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you they will not prove submissive and unless submissive then will be practically useless if when the soldiers have become attached to you punishments are not enforced they will still be unless therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity but kept under control by means of iron discipline yen tzu bc said of ssuma jangchu his civil virtues endeared him to the people his martial prowess kept his enemies in awe cf wu tzu ch init the ideal commander unites culture with a warlike temper the profession of arms requires a combination of hardness and tenderness this is a certain road to victory if in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced the army will be welldisciplined if not its discipline will be bad if a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed tu mu says a general ought in time of peace to show kindly confidence in his men and also make his authority respected so that when they come to face the enemy orders may be executed and discipline maintained because the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom they all trust and look up to him what sun tzu has said in ss however would lead one rather to expect something like this if a general is always confident that his orders will be carried out etc the gain will be mutual chang yu says the general has confidence in the men under his command and the men are docile having confidence in him thus the gain is mutual he quotes a pregnant sentence from wei liao tzu ch the art of giving orders is not to try to rectify minor blunders and not to be swayed by petty doubts vacillation and fussiness are the surest means of sapping the confidence of an army aids to scouting p the ait of wai by sxm jim ids the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom x terrain only about a third of the chapter comprising ss ss deals with terrain the subject being more fully treated in ch xi the six calamities are discussed in ss and the rest of the chapter is again a mere string of desultory remarks though not less interesting perhaps on that account sun tzu said we may distinguish six kinds of terrain to wit accessible ground mei yaochf en says plentifully provided with roads and means of communications entangling ground the same commentator says netlike country venturing into which you become entangled temporizing ground ground which allows you to stave off or delay narrow passes precipitous heights positions at a great distance from the enemy it is hardly necessary to point out the faultiness of this classification a strange lack of logical perception is shown in the chinamans unquestioning acceptance of glaring crossdivisions such as the above ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called accessible with regard to ground of this nature be before the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots and carefully guard your line of supplies the general meaning of the last phrase is doubtlessly as tu yu says not to allow the enemy to cut your communications in view of napoleons dictum the secret of war lies in the communications we could wish that sun tzu had done more than skirt the edge of this important subject here and in i ss vii ss col henderson says the line of supply may be said to be as vital to the existence of an army as the heart to the life of a human the an of war by svm tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom being just as the duelist who finds his adversarys point menacing him with certain death and his own guard astray is compelled to conform to his adversarys movements and to content himself with warding off his thrusts so the commander whose communications are suddenly threatened finds himself in a false position and he will be fortunate if he has not to change all his plans to split up his force into more or less isolated detachments and to fight with inferior numbers on ground which he has not had time to prepare and where defeat will not be an ordinary failure but will entail the ruin or surrender of his whole army then you will be able to fight with advantage ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re occupy is called entangling from a position of this sort if the enemy is unprepared you may sally forth and defeat him but if the enemy is prepared for your coming and you fail to defeat him then return being impossible disaster will ensue when the position is such that neither side will gain by making the first move it is called temporizing ground tu mu says each side finds it inconvenient to move and the situation remains at a deadlock in a position of this sort even though the enemy should offer us an attractive bait tu yu says turning their backs on us and pretending to flee but this is only one of the lures which might induce us to quit our position it will be advisable not to stir forth but rather to retreat thus enticing the enemy in his turn then when part of his army has come out we may deliver our attack with advantage with regard to narrow passes if you can occupy them first let them be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy the art of wax by sxm tzn the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom because then as tu yu observes the initiative will lie with us and by making sudden and unexpected attacks we shall have the enemy at our mercy should the army forestall you in occupying a pass do not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned but only if it is weakly garrisoned with regard to precipitous heights if you are beforehand with your adversary you should occupy the raised and sunny spots and there wait for him to come up tsao kung says the particular advantage of securing heights and defiles is that your actions cannot then be dictated by the enemy for the enunciation of the grand principle alluded to see vi ss chang yu tells the following anecdote of pei hsingchien ad who was sent on a punitive expedition against the turkic tribes at night he pitched his camp as usual and it had already been completely fortified by wall and ditch when suddenly he gave orders that the army should shift its quarters to a hill near by this was highly displeasing to his officers who protested loudly against the extra fatigue which it would entail on the men p x ei hsingchien however paid no heed to their remonstrances and had the camp moved as quickly as possible the same night a terrific storm came on which flooded their former place of encampment to the depth of over twelve feet the recalcitrant officers were amazed at the sight and owned that they had been in the wrong how did you know what was going to happen they asked pei hsingchien replied from this time forward be content to obey orders without asking unnecessary questions from this it may be seen chang yu continues that high and sunny places are advantageous not only for fighting but also because they are immune from disastrous floods if the enemy has occupied them before you do not follow him but retreat and try to entice him away the turning point of li shihmins campaign in ad against the two rebels tou chiente king of hsia and wang shihchfung prince of cheng was his seizure of the heights of wulao in spike of which tou chiente persisted the art of war by srm tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom in his attempt to relieve his ally in loyang was defeated and taken prisoner see chiu tang ch fol verso and also ch if you are situated at a great distance from the enemy and the strength of the two armies is equal it is not easy to provoke a battle the point is that we must not think of undertaking a long and wearisome march at the end of which as tu yu says we should be exhausted and our adversary fresh and keen and fighting will be to your disadvantage these six are the principles connected with earth or perhaps the principles relating to ground see however i ss the general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to study them now an army is exposed to six several calamities not arising from natural causes but from faults for which the general is responsible these are flight insubordination collapse ruin disorganization rout other conditions being equal if one force is hurled against another ten times its size the result will be the flight of the former when the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak the result is insubordination tu mu cites the unhappy case of tien pu hsin tang shu ch who was sent to wei in ad with orders to lead an army against wang tingtsou but the whole time he was in command his soldiers treated him with the utmost contempt and openly flouted his authority by riding about the camp on donkeys several thousands at a time tien pu was powerless to put a stop to this conduct and when after some months had passed he made an attempt to engage the enemy his troops turned tail and dispersed in the art of war by srm tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom every direction after that the unfortunate man committed suicide by cutting his throat when the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak the result is collapse tsao kung says the officers are energetic and want to press on the common soldiers are feeble and suddenly collapse when the higher officers are angry and insubordinate and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment before the commanderinchief can tell whether or no he is in a position to fight the result is ruin wang hsis note is this means the general is angry without cause and at the same time does not appreciate the ability of his subordinate officers thus he arouses fierce resentment and brings an avalanche of ruin upon his head when the general is weak and without authority when his orders are not clear and distinct wei liao tzu ch says if the commander gives his orders with decision the soldiers will not wait to hear them twice if his moves are made without vacillation the soldiers will not be in two minds about doing their duty general badenpowell says italicizing the words the secret of getting successful work out of your trained men lies in one nutshell â€” in the clearness of the instructions they receive cf also wu tzu ch the most fatal defect in a military leader is difference the worst calamities that befall an army arise from hesitation when there are no fixed duties assigned to officers and men tu mu says neither officers nor men have any regular routine and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner the result is utter disorganization when a general unable to estimate the enemys strength allows an inferior force to engage a larger the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom one or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank the result must be rout chang yu paraphrases the latter part of the sentence and continues whenever there is fighting to be done the keenest spirits should be appointed to serve in the front ranks both in order to strengthen the resolution of our own men and to demoralize the enemy cf the primi ordines of caesar de bello gallico v et al these are six ways of courting defeat which must be carefully noted by the general who has attained a responsible post see supra ss the natural formation of the country is the soldiers best ally chf en hao says the advantages of weather and season are not equal to those connected with ground but a power of estimating the adversary of controlling the forces of victory and of shrewdly calculating difficulties dangers and distances constitutes the test of a great general he who knows these things and in fighting puts his knowledge into practice will win his battles he who knows them not nor practices them will surely be defeated if fighting is sure to result in victory then you must fight even though the ruler forbid it if fighting will not result in victory then you must not fight even at the rulers bidding cf viii ss fin huang shihkung of the chun dynasty who is said to have been the patron of chang liang and to have written the san lueh has these words attributed to him the responsibility of setting an army in motion must devolve on the general alone if advance and retreat are controlled from the palace brilliant results will hardly be achieved hence the godlike ruler and the enlightened the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom monarch are content to play a humble part in furthering their countrys cause lit kneel down to push the chariot wheel this means that in matters lying outside the zenana the decision of the military commander must be absolute chang yu also quote the saying decrees from the son of heaven do not penetrate the walls of a camp the general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace it was wellington i think who said that the hardest thing of all for a soldier is to retreat whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign is the jewel of the kingdom a noble presentiment in few words of the chinese happy warrior such a man says ho shih even if he had to suffer punishment would not regret his conduct regard your soldiers as your children and they will follow you into the deepest valleys look upon them as your own beloved sons and they will stand by you even unto death cf i ss in this connection tu mu draws for us an engaging picture of the famous general wu chfi from whose treatise on war i have frequently had occasion to quote he wore the same clothes and ate the same food as the meanest of his soldiers refused to have either a horse to ride or a mat to sleep on carried his own surplus rations wrapped in a parcel and shared every hardship with his men one of his soldiers was suffering from an abscess and wu chfi himself sucked out the virus the soldiers mother hearing this began wailing and lamenting somebody asked her saying why do you cry your son is only a common soldier and yet the commanderinchief himself has sucked the poison from his sore the woman replied many years ago lord wu performed a similar service for my husband who never left him afterwards and finally met his death at the hands of the enemy and now that he has done the same for my son he too will fall fighting i know not where li chf uan mentions the viscount of chf u who invaded the small state of hsiao during the winter the duke of shen the art of wai by sim izu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom said to him many of the soldiers are suffering severely from the cold so he made a round of the whole army comforting and encouraging the men and straightway they felt as if they were clothed in garments lined with floss silk if however you are indulgent but unable to make your authority felt kindhearted but unable to enforce your commands and incapable moreover of quelling disorder then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children they are useless for any practical purpose li ching once said that if you could make your soldiers afraid of you they would not be afraid of the enemy tu mu recalls an instance of stern military discipline which occurred in ad when lu meng was occupying the town of chiangling he had given stringent orders to his army not to molest the inhabitants nor take anything from them by force nevertheless a certain officer serving under his banner who happened to be a fellowtownsman ventured to appropriate a bamboo hat belonging to one of the people in order to wear it over his regulation helmet as a protection against the rain lu meng considered that the fact of his being also a native of junan should not be allowed to palliate a clear breach of discipline and accordingly he ordered his summary execution the tears rolling down his face however as he did so this act of severity filled the army with wholesome awe and from that time forth even articles dropped in the highway were not picked up if we know that our own men are in a condition to attack but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack we have gone only halfway towards victory that is tsao kung says the issue in this case is uncertain if we know that the enemy is open to attack but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack we have gone only halfway towards victory cf iii ss the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom if we know that the enemy is open to attack and also know that our men are in a condition to attack but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable we have still gone only halfway towards victory hence the experienced soldier once in motion is never bewildered once he has broken camp he is never at a loss the reason being according to tu mu that he has taken his measures so thoroughly as to ensure victory beforehand he does not move recklessly says chang yu so that when he does move he makes no mistakes hence the saying if you know the enemy and know yourself your victory will not stand in doubt if you know heaven and know earth you may make your victory complete li chfuan sums up as follows given a knowledge of three things â€” the affairs of men the seasons of heaven and the natural advantages of earth â€” victory will invariably crown your battles see pensees de napoleon er no the science of war chap aids to scouting p xii the art of war by srm tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom xl the nine situations sun tzu said the art of war recognizes nine varieties of ground dispersive ground facile ground contentious ground open ground ground of intersecting highways serious ground difficult ground hemmedin ground desperate ground when a chieftain is fighting in his own territory it is dispersive ground so called because the soldiers being near to their homes and anxious to see their wives and children are likely to seize the opportunity afforded by a battle and scatter in every direction in their advance observes tu mu they will lack the valor of desperation and when they retreat they will find harbors of refuge when he has penetrated into hostile territory but to no great distance it is facile ground li chfuan and ho shih say because of the facility for retreating and the other commentators give similar explanations tu mu remarks when your army has crossed the border you should burn your boats and bridges in order to make it clear to everybody that you have no hankering after home ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side is contentious ground tu mu defines the ground as ground to be contended for tsao kung says ground on which the few and the weak can defeat the many and the strong such as the neck of a pass instanced by li chfuan thus thermopylae was of this classification because the possession of it even for a few days only meant holding the entire invading army in check and thus gaining invaluable time cf wu tzu ch v ad in it for those who have to fight in the ratio of one to ten there is nothing better than a narrow pass when lu kuang was returning from his triumphant expedition to turkestan in ad and had got as far as lho laden with spoils liang hsi administrator of liangchou taking the art of wai by sim tzu iis the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom advantage of the death of fu chien king of chun plotted against him and was for barring his way into the province yang han governor of kaochf ang counseled him saying lu kuang is fresh from his victories in the west and his soldiers are vigorous and mettlesome if we oppose him in the shifting sands of the desert we shall be no match for him and we must therefore try a different plan let us hasten to occupy the defile at the mouth of the kaowu pass thus cutting him off from supplies of water and when his troops are prostrated with thirst we can dictate our own terms without moving or if you think that the pass i mention is too far off we could make a stand against him at the lwu pass which is nearer the cunning and resource of tzufang himself would be expended in vain against the enormous strength of these two positions liang hsi refusing to act on this advice was overwhelmed and swept away by the invader ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground there are various interpretations of the chinese adjective for this type of ground tsao kung says it means ground covered with a network of roads like a chessboard ho shih suggested ground on which intercommunication is easy ground which forms the key to three contiguous states tsau kung defines this as our country adjoining the enemys and a third country conterminous with both meng shih instances the small principality of cheng which was bounded on the northeast by chfi on the west by chin and on the south by chfu so that he who occupies it first has most of the empire at his command the belligerent who holds this dominating position can constrain most of them to become his allies is a ground of intersecting highways the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom when an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear it is serious ground wang hsi explains the name by saying that when an army has reached such a point its situation is serious mountain forests or simply forests rugged steeps marshes and fens â€” all country that is hard to traverse this is difficult ground ground which is reached through narrow gorges and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men this is hemmed in ground ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay is desperate ground the situation as pictured by tsao kung is very similar to the hemmedin ground except that here escape is no longer possible a lofty mountain in front a large river behind advance impossible retreat blocked chfen hao says to be on desperate ground is like sitting in a leaking boat or crouching in a burning house tu mu quotes from li ching a vivid description of the plight of an army thus entrapped suppose an army invading hostile territory without the aid of local guides â€” it falls into a fatal snare and is at the enemys mercy a ravine on the left a mountain on the right a pathway so perilous that the horses have to be roped together and the chariots carried in slings no passage open in front retreat cut off behind no choice but to proceed in single file then before there is time to range our soldiers in order of battle the enemy is overwhelming strength suddenly appears on the scene advancing we can nowhere take a breathingspace retreating we have no haven of refuge we seek a pitched battle but in vain yet standing on the defensive none of us has a moments respite if we simply maintain our ground whole days and months will crawl by the moment we make a move we have the ait of wai by sim izu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom to sustain the enemys attacks on front and rear the country is wild destitute of water and plants the army is lacking in the necessaries of life the horses are jaded and the men wornout all the resources of strength and skill unavailing the pass so narrow that a single man defending it can check the onset of ten thousand all means of offense in the hands of the enemy all points of vantage already forfeited by ourselves in this terrible plight even though we had the most valiant soldiers and the keenest of weapons how could they be employed with the slightest effect students of greek history may be reminded of the awful close to the sicilian expedition and the agony of the athenians under nicias and demonsthenes see thucydides vii sqq on dispersive ground therefore fight not on facile ground halt not on contentious ground attack not but rather let all your energies be bent on occupying the advantageous position first so tsao kung li chfuan and others however suppose the meaning to be that the enemy has already forestalled us sot that it would be sheer madness to attack in the sun tzu hsu lu when the king of wu inquires what should be done in this case sun tzu replies the rule with regard to contentious ground is that those in possession have the advantage over the other side if a position of this kind is secured first by the enemy beware of attacking him lure him away by pretending to flee â€” show your banners and sound your drums â€” make a dash for other places that he cannot afford to lose â€” trail brushwood and raise a dust â€” confound his ears and eyes â€” detach a body of your best troops and place it secretly in ambuscade then your opponent will sally forth to the rescue on open ground do not try to block the enemys way because the attempt would be futile and would expose the blocking force itself to serious risks there are two interpretations available here i follow that of chang yu the other is indicated in tsao kungs brief note draw closer together â€” ie see that a portion of your own army is not cut off the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom on the ground of intersecting highways join hands with your allies or perhaps form alliances with neighboring states on serious ground gather in plunder on this li chfuan has the following delicious note when an army penetrates far into the enemys country care must be taken not to alienate the people by unjust treatment follow the example of the han emperor kao tsu whose march into chun territory was marked by no violation of women or looting of valuables nota dene this was in bc and may well cause us to blush for the christian armies that entered peking in ad thus he won the hearts of all in the present passage then i think that the true reading must be not plunder but do not plunder alas i fear that in this instance the worthy commentators feelings outran his judgment tu mu at least has no such illusions he says when encamped on serious ground there being no inducement as yet to advance further and no possibility of retreat one ought to take measures for a protracted resistance by bringing in provisions from all sides and keep a close watch on the enemy in difficult ground keep steadily on the march or in the words of viii ss do not encamp on hemmedin ground resort to stratagem tsau kung says try the effect of some unusual artifice and tu yu amplifies this by saying in such a position some scheme must be devised which will suit the circumstances and if we can succeed in deluding the enemy the peril may be escaped this is exactly what happened on the famous occasion when hannibal was hemmed in among the mountains on the road to casilinum and to all appearances entrapped by the dictator fabius the stratagem which hannibal devised to baffle his foes was remarkably like that which tien tan had also employed with success exactly years before see ix ss note when night came on bundles of twigs were fastened to the horns of some oxen and set on fire the terrified animals being then quickly driven along the mountain side towards the passes which were beset by the enemy the the an of war by svm tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom strange spectacle of these rapidly moving lights so alarmed and discomfited the romans that they withdrew from their position and hannibals army passed safely through the defile see polybius iii livy xxii on desperate ground fight for as chia lin remarks if you fight with all your might there is a chance of life where as death is certain if you cling to your corner those who were called skillful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge between the enemys front and rear more literally cause the front and rear to lose touch with each other to prevent cooperation between his large and small divisions to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad the officers from rallying their men when the enemys men were united they managed to keep them in disorder when it was to their advantage they made a forward move when otherwise they stopped still mei yaochfen connects this with the foregoing having succeeded in thus dislocating the enemy they would push forward in order to secure any advantage to be gained if there was no advantage to be gained they would remain where they were if asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack i should say begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear then he will be amenable to your will opinions differ as to what sun tzu had in mind tsao kung thinks it is some strategical advantage on which the enemy is depending tu mu says the three things which an enemy is anxious to do and on the accomplishment of which his success depends are to capture our favorable positions to ravage our cultivated land to guard his the art of wax by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom own communications our object then must be to thwart his plans in these three directions and thus render him helpless cf iii ss by boldly seizing the initiative in this way you at once throw the other side on the defensive rapidity is the essence of war according to tu mu this is a summary of leading principles in warfare and he adds these are the profoundest truths of military science and the chief business of the general the following anecdotes told by ho shih shows the importance attached to speed by two of chinas greatest generals in ad meng ta governor of hsin chfeng under the wei emperor wen ti was meditating defection to the house of shu and had entered into correspondence with chuko liang prime minister of that state the wei general ssuma i was then military governor of wan and getting wind of meng tas treachery he at once set off with an army to anticipate his revolt having previously cajoled him by a specious message of friendly import ssumas officers came to him and said if meng ta has leagued himself with wu and shu the matter should be thoroughly investigated before we make a move ssuma i replied meng ta is an unprincipled man and we ought to go and punish him at once while he is still wavering and before he has thrown off the mask then by a series of forced marches be brought his army under the walls of hsinchfeng with in a space of eight days now meng ta had previously said in a letter to chuko liang wan is li from here when the news of my revolt reaches ssuma i he will at once inform his imperial master but it will be a whole month before any steps can be taken and by that time my city will be well fortified besides ssuma i is sure not to come himself and the generals that will be sent against us are not worth troubling about the next letter however was filled with consternation though only eight days have passed since i threw off my allegiance an army is already at the citygates what miraculous rapidity is this a fortnight later hsinchfeng had fallen and meng ta had lost his head see chin shu ch f in ad li ching was sent from icueichou in ssuchf uan to reduce the successful rebel hsiao hsien who had set up as emperor at the modern chingchou fu in hupeh it was autumn and the yangtsze being then in flood hsiao hsien never dreamt that the ait of wax by sim izu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom his adversary would venture to come down through the gorges and consequently made no preparations but li ching embarked his army without loss of time and was just about to start when the other generals implored him to postpone his departure until the river was in a less dangerous state for navigation li ching replied to the soldier overwhelming speed is of paramount importance and he must never miss opportunities now is the time to strike before hsiao hsien even knows that we have got an army together if we seize the present moment when the river is in flood we shall appear before his capital with startling suddenness like the thunder which is heard before you have time to stop your ears against it see vii ss note this is the great principle in war even if he gets to know of our approach he will have to levy his soldiers in such a hurry that they will not be fit to oppose us thus the full fruits of victory will be ours all came about as he predicted and hsiao hsien was obliged to surrender nobly stipulating that his people should be spared and he alone suffer the penalty of death take advantage of the enemys unreadiness make your way by unexpected routes and attack unguarded spots the following are the principles to be observed by an invading force the further you penetrate into a country the greater will be the solidarity of your troops and thus the defenders will not prevail against you make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with food cf supra ss li chf uan does not venture on a note here carefully study the wellbeing of your men for wellbeing wang hsi means pet them humor them give them plenty of food and drink and look after them generally and do not overtax them concentrate your energy and hoard your strength the art of wai by sim izu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom chf en recalls the line of action adopted in bc by the famous general wang chien whose military genius largely contributed to the success of the first emperor he had invaded the chf u state where a universal levy was made to oppose him but being doubtful of the temper of his troops he declined all invitations to fight and remained strictly on the defensive in vain did the chfu general try to force a battle day after day wang chien kept inside his walls and would not come out but devoted his whole time and energy to winning the affection and confidence of his men he took care that they should be well fed sharing his own meals with them provided facilities for bathing and employed every method of judicious indulgence to weld them into a loyal and homogenous body after some time had elapsed he told off certain persons to find out how the men were amusing themselves the answer was that they were contending with one another in putting the weight and long jumping when wang chien heard that they were engaged in these athletic pursuits he knew that their spirits had been strung up to the required pitch and that they were now ready for fighting by this time the chfu army after repeating their challenge again and again had marched away eastwards in disgust the chf in general immediately broke up his camp and followed them and in the battle that ensued they were routed with great slaughter shortly afterwards the whole of chfu was conquered by chf in and the king fuchf u led into captivity keep your army continually on the move in order that the enemy may never know exactly where you are it has struck me however that the true reading might be link your army together and devise unfathomable plans throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape and they will prefer death to flight if they will face death there is nothing they may not achieve chang yu quotes his favorite wei liao tzu ch if one man were to run amok with a sword in the marketplace and everybody else tried to get our of his way i should not allow that this man alone had courage and that all the rest the an of wai by sim tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom were contemptible cowards the truth is that a desperado and a man who sets some value on his life do not meet on even terms officers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength chang yu says if they are in an awkward place together they will surely exert their united strength to get out of it soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear if there is no place of refuge they will stand firm if they are in hostile country they will show a stubborn front if there is no help for it they will fight hard thus without waiting to be marshaled the soldiers will be constantly on the qui vive without waiting to be asked they will do your will literally without asking you will get without restrictions they will be faithful without giving orders they can be trusted prohibit the taking of omens and do away with superstitious doubts then until death itself comes no calamity need be feared the superstitious bound in to saucy doubts and fears degenerate into cowards and die many times before their deaths tu mu quotes huang shihkung spells and incantations should be strictly forbidden and no officer allowed to inquire by divination into the fortunes of an army for fear the soldiers minds should be seriously perturbed the meaning is he continues that if all doubts and scruples are discarded your men will never falter in their resolution until they die if our soldiers are not overburdened with money it is not because they have a distaste for riches if their lives are not unduly long it is not because they are disinclined to longevity the art of wai by sim izu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom chang yu has the best note on this passage wealth and long life are things for which all men have a natural inclination hence if they burn or fling away valuables and sacrifice their own lives it is not that they dislike them but simply that they have no choice sun tzu is slyly insinuating that as soldiers are but human it is for the general to see that temptations to shirk fighting and grow rich are not thrown in their way on the day they are ordered out to battle your soldiers may weep the word in the chinese is snivel this is taken to indicate more genuine grief than tears alone those sitting up bedewing their garments and those lying down letting the tears run down their cheeks not because they are afraid but because as tsao kung says all have embraced the firm resolution to do or die we may remember that the heroes of the iliad were equally childlike in showing their emotion chang yu alludes to the mournful parting at the i river between ching k x o and his friends when the former was sent to attempt the life of the king of chun afterwards first emperor in bc the tears of all flowed down like rain as he bade them farewell and uttered the following lines the shrill blast is blowing chilly the burn your champion is going â€” not to return but let them once be brought to bay and they will display the courage of a chu or a kuei chu was the personal name of chuan chu a native of the wu state and contemporary with sun tzu himself who was employed by kungtzu kuang better known as ho lu wang to assassinate his sovereign wang liao with a dagger which he secreted in the belly of a fish served up at a banquet he succeeded in his attempt but was immediately hacked to pieced by the kings bodyguard this was in bc the other hero referred to tsao kuei or tsao mo performed the exploit which has made his name famous years earlier in bc lu had been thrice defeated by chfi and was just about to conclude a treaty surrendering a large slice of territory when tsao kuei suddenly seized huan kung the duke of chu as he stood on the altar steps the art of wai by sim tzu s the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom and held a dagger against his chest none of the dukes retainers dared to move a muscle and tsao kuei proceeded to demand full restitution declaring the lu was being unjustly treated because she was a smaller and a weaker state huan kung in peril of his life was obliged to consent whereupon tsao kuei flung away his dagger and quietly resumed his place amid the terrified assemblage without having so much as changed color as was to be expected the duke wanted afterwards to repudiate the bargain but his wise old counselor kuan chung pointed out to him the impolicy of breaking his word and the upshot was that this bold stroke regained for lu the whole of what she had lost in three pitched battles the skillful tactician may be likened to the shuai j an now the shuaij an is a snake that is found in the ch x ang mountains shuaijan means suddenly or rapidly and the snake in question was doubtless so called owing to the rapidity of its movements through this passage the term in the chinese has now come to be used in the sense of military maneuvers strike at its head and you will be attacked by its tail strike at its tail and you will be attacked by its head strike at its middle and you will be attacked by head and tail both asked if an army can be made to imitate the shuai j an that is as mei yaochfen says is it possible to make the front and rear of an army each swiftly responsive to attack on the other just as though they were part of a single living body i should answer yes for the men of wu and the men of yueh are enemies cf vi ss yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm they will come to each the art of wax by sun tzn the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom others assistance just as the left hand helps the right the meaning is if two enemies will help each other in a time of common peril how much more should two parts of the same army bound together as they are by every tie of interest and fellowfeeling yet it is notorious that many a campaign has been ruined through lack of cooperation especially in the case of allied armies hence it is not enough to put ones trust in the tethering of horses and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground these quaint devices to prevent ones army from running away recall the athenian hero sophanes who carried the anchor with him at the battle of plataea by means of which he fastened himself firmly to one spot see herodotus ix it is not enough says sun tzu to render flight impossible by such mechanical means you will not succeed unless your men have tenacity and unity of purpose and above all a spirit of sympathetic cooperation this is the lesson which can be learned from the shuai jan the principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of courage which all must reach literally level the courage of all as though it were that of one if the ideal army is to form a single organic whole then it follows that the resolution and spirit of its component parts must be of the same quality or at any rate must not fall below a certain standard wellingtons seemingly ungrateful description of his army at waterloo as the worst he had ever commanded meant no more than that it was deficient in this important particular â€” unity of spirit and courage had he not foreseen the belgian defections and carefully kept those troops in the background he would almost certainly have lost the day how to make the best of both strong and weak â€” that is a question involving the proper use of ground mei yaochfens paraphrase is the way to eliminate the differences of strong and weak and to make both the art of wai by sim tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom serviceable is to utilize accidental features of the ground less reliable troops if posted in strong positions will hold out as long as better troops on more exposed terrain the advantage of position neutralizes the inferiority in stamina and courage col henderson says with all respect to the text books and to the ordinary tactical teaching i am inclined to think that the study of ground is often overlooked and that by no means sufficient importance is attached to the selection of positions and to the immense advantages that are to be derived whether you are defending or attacking from the proper utilization of natural features thus the skillful general conducts his army just as though he were leading a single man willynilly by the hand tu mu says the simile has reference to the ease with which he does it it is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy upright and just and thus maintain order he must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and appearances literally to deceive their eyes and ears and thus keep them in total ignorance tsao kung gives us one of his excellent apophthegms the troops must not be allowed to share your schemes in the beginning they may only rejoice with you over their happy outcome to mystify mislead and surprise the enemy is one of the first principles in war as had been frequently pointed out but how about the other process â€” the mystification of ones own men those who may think that sun tzu is overemphatic on this point would do well to read col hendersons remarks on stonewall jacksons valley campaign the infinite pains he says with which jackson sought to conceal even from his most trusted staff officers his movements his intentions and his thoughts a commander less thorough would have pronounced useless â€” etc etc in the year ad as we read in ch of the hou han shu pan chf ao took the field with the art of wax by sxm tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom men from khotan and other central asian states with the object of crushing yarkand the king of kutcha replied by dispatching his chief commander to succor the place with an army drawn from the kingdoms of wensu kumo and weifou totaling men pan chfao summoned his officers and also the king of khotan to a council of war and said our forces are now outnumbered and unable to make head against the enemy the best plan then is for us to separate and disperse each in a different direction the king of khotan will march away by the easterly route and i will then return myself towards the west let us wait until the evening drum has sounded and then start pan chfao now secretly released the prisoners whom he had taken alive and the king of kutcha was thus informed of his plans much elated by the news the latter set off at once at the head of horsemen to bar pan chfaos retreat in the west while the king of wensu rode eastward with horse in order to intercept the king of khotan as soon as pan chfao knew that the two chieftains had gone he called his divisions together got them well in hand and at cockcrow hurled them against the army of yarkand as it lay encamped the barbarians panicstricken fled in confusion and were closely pursued by pan chfao over heads were brought back as trophies besides immense spoils in the shape of horses and cattle and valuables of every description yarkand then capitulating kutcha and the other kingdoms drew off their respective forces from that time forward pan chfaos prestige completely overawed the countries of the west in this case we see that the chinese general not only kept his own officers in ignorance of his real plans but actually took the bold step of dividing his army in order to deceive the enemy by altering his arrangements and changing his plans wang hsi thinks that this means not using the same stratagem twice he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge chang yu in a quotation from another work says the axiom that war is based on deception does not apply only to deception of the enemy you must deceive even your own the art of wax by sxm tzn the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom soldiers make them follow you but without letting them know why by shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose at the critical moment the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him he carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand literally releases the spring see v ss that is takes some decisive step which makes it impossible for the army to return â€” like hsiang yu who sunk his ships after crossing a river chfen hao followed by chia lin understands the words less well as puts forth every artifice at his command he burns his boats and breaks his cookingpots like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep he drives his men this way and that and nothing knows whither he is going tu mu says the army is only cognizant of orders to advance or retreat it is ignorant of the ulterior ends of attacking and conquering to muster his host and bring it into danger â€” this may be termed the business of the general sun tzu means that after mobilization there should be no delay in aiming a blow at the enemys heart note how he returns again and again to this point among the warring states of ancient china desertion was no doubt a much more present fear and serious evil than it is in the armies of today the different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground chang yu says one must not be hidebound in interpreting the rules for the nine varieties of ground the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics and the fundamental laws of human nature these are things that must most certainly be studied the art of war by srm tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom when invading hostile territory the general principle is that penetrating deeply brings cohesion penetrating but a short way means dispersion cf supra ss when you leave your own country behind and take your army across neighborhood territory you find yourself on critical ground this ground is curiously mentioned in viii ss but it does not figure among the nine situations or the six calamities in chap x ones first impulse would be to translate it distant ground but this if we can trust the commentators is precisely what is not meant here mei yao chfen says it is a position not far enough advanced to be called facile and not near enough to home to be dispersive but something between the two wang hsi says it is ground separated from home by an interjacent state whose territory we have had to cross in order to reach it hence it is incumbent on us to settle our business there quickly he adds that this position is of rare occurrence which is the reason why it is not included among the nine situations when there are means of communication on all four sides the ground is one of intersecting highways when you penetrate deeply into a country it is serious ground when you penetrate but a little way it is facile ground when you have the enemys strongholds on your rear and narrow passes in front it is hemmedin ground when there is no place of refuge at all it is desperate ground therefore on dispersive ground i would inspire my men with unity of purpose this end according to tu mu is best attained by remaining on the defensive and avoiding battle cf supra ss the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom on facile ground i would see that there is close connection between all parts of my army as tu mu says the object is to guard against two possible contingencies the desertion of our own troops a sudden attack on the part of the enemy cf vii ss mei yaochfen says on the march the regiments should be in close touch in an encampment there should be continuity between the fortifications on contentious ground i would hurry up my rear this is tsao kungs interpretation chang yu adopts it saying we must quickly bring up our rear so that head and tail may both reach the goal that is they must not be allowed to straggle up a long way apart mei yaochfen offers another equally plausible explanation supposing the enemy has not yet reached the coveted position and we are behind him we should advance with all speed in order to dispute its possession chf en hao on the other hand assuming that the enemy has had time to select his own ground quotes vi ss where sun tzu warns us against coming exhausted to the attack his own idea of the situation is rather vaguely expressed if there is a favorable position lying in front of you detach a picked body of troops to occupy it then if the enemy relying on their numbers come up to make a fight for it you may fall quickly on their rear with your main body and victory will be assured it was thus he adds that chao she beat the army of chun see p on open ground i would keep a vigilant eye on my defenses on ground of intersecting highways i would consolidate my alliances on serious ground i would try to ensure a continuous stream of supplies the commentators take this as referring to forage and plunder not as one might expect to an unbroken communication with a home base on difficult ground i would keep pushing on along the road the art of wax by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom on hemmedin ground i would block any way of retreat meng shih says to make it seem that i meant to defend the position whereas my real intention is to burst suddenly through the enemys lines mei yaochfen says in order to make my soldiers fight with desperation wang hsi says fearing lest my men be tempted to run away tu mu points out that this is the converse of vii ss where it is the enemy who is surrounded in ad kao huan afterwards emperor and canonized as shenwu was surrounded by a great army under erhchu chao and others his own force was comparatively small consisting only of horse and something under foot the lines of investment had not been drawn very closely together gaps being left at certain points but kao huan instead of trying to escape actually made a shift to block all the remaining outlets himself by driving into them a number of oxen and donkeys roped together as soon as his officers and men saw that there was nothing for it but to conquer or die their spirits rose to an extraordinary pitch of exaltation and they charged with such desperate ferocity that the opposing ranks broke and crumbled under their onslaught on desperate ground i would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness of saving their lives tu yu says burn your baggage and impedimenta throw away your stores and provisions choke up the wells destroy your cookingstoves and make it plain to your men that they cannot survive but must fight to the death mei yaochfen says the only chance of life lies in giving up all hope of it this concludes what sun tzu has to say about grounds and the variations corresponding to them reviewing the passages which bear on this important subject we cannot fail to be struck by the desultory and unmethodical fashion in which it is treated sun tzu begins abruptly in viii ss to enumerate variations before touching on grounds at all but only mentions five namely nos and of the subsequent list and one that is not included in it a few varieties of ground are dealt with in the earlier portion of chap ix and then chap x sets forth six new grounds with six variations of plan to match none of these is mentioned again though the first is hardly to be the art of war by srm tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom distinguished from ground no in the next chapter at last in chap xi we come to the nine grounds par excellence immediately followed by the variations this takes us down to ss in ss fresh definitions are provided for nos and in the order given as well as for the tenth ground noticed in chap viii and finally the nine variations are enumerated once more from beginning to end all with the exception of and being different from those previously given though it is impossible to account for the present state of sun tzus text a few suggestive facts maybe brought into prominence chap viii according to the title should deal with nine variations whereas only five appear it is an abnormally short chapter chap xi is entitled the nine grounds several of these are defined twice over besides which there are two distinct lists of the corresponding variations the length of the chapter is disproportionate being double that of any other except ix i do not propose to draw any inferences from these facts beyond the general conclusion that sun tzus work cannot have come down to us in the shape in which it left his hands chap viii is obviously defective and probably out of place while xi seems to contain matter that has either been added by a later hand or ought to appear elsewhere for it is the soldiers disposition to offer an obstinate resistance when surrounded to fight hard when he cannot help himself and to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger chang yu alludes to the conduct of pan chfaos devoted followers in ad the story runs thus in the hou han shu ch when pan chfao arrived at shanshan kuang the king of the country received him at first with great politeness and respect but shortly afterwards his behavior underwent a sudden change and he became remiss and negligent pan chfao spoke about this to the officers of his suite have you noticed he said that kuangs polite intentions are on the wane this must signify that envoys have come from the northern barbarians and that consequently he is in a state of indecision not knowing with which side to throw in his lot that surely is the reason the truly wise man we are told can perceive things before the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom they have come to pass how much more then those that are already manifest thereupon he called one of the natives who had been assigned to his service and set a trap for him saying where are those envoys from the hsiungnu who arrived some day ago the man was so taken aback that between surprise and fear he presently blurted out the whole truth pan chfao keeping his informant carefully under lock and key then summoned a general gathering of his officers thirtysix in all and began drinking with them when the wine had mounted into their heads a little he tried to rouse their spirit still further by addressing them thus gentlemen here we are in the heart of an isolated region anxious to achieve riches and honor by some great exploit now it happens that an ambassador from the hsiungno arrived in this kingdom only a few days ago and the result is that the respectful courtesy extended towards us by our royal host has disappeared should this envoy prevail upon him to seize our party and hand us over to the hsiungno our bones will become food for the wolves of the desert what are we to do with one accord the officers replied standing as we do in peril of our lives we will follow our commander through life and death for the sequel of this adventure see chap xii ss note we cannot enter into alliance with neighboring princes until we are acquainted with their designs we are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country â€” its mountains and forests its pitfalls and precipices its marshes and swamps we shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides these three sentences are repeated from vii ss in order to emphasize their importance the commentators seem to think i prefer to regard them as interpolated here in order to form an antecedent to the following words with regard to local guides sun tzu might have added that there is always the risk of going wrong either through their treachery or some misunderstanding such as livy records xxii hannibal we are told ordered a guide to lead him into the neighborhood of casinum where there was an important pass to be the an of wai by sim tzu s the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom occupied but his carthaginian accent unsuited to the pronunciation of latin names caused the guide to understand casilinum instead of casinum and turning from his proper route he took the army in that direction the mistake not being discovered until they had almost arrived to be ignored of any one of the following four or five principles does not befit a warlike prince when a warlike prince attacks a powerful state his generalship shows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemys forces he overawes his opponents and their allies are prevented from joining against him mei taochf en constructs one of the chains of reasoning that are so much affected by the chinese in attacking a powerful state if you can divide her forces you will have a superiority in strength if you have a superiority in strength you will overawe the enemy if you overawe the enemy the neighboring states will be frightened and if the neighboring states are frightened the enemys allies will be prevented from joining her the following gives a stronger meaning if the great state has once been defeated before she has had time to summon her allies then the lesser states will hold aloof and refrain from massing their forces chfen hao and chang yu take the sentence in quite another way the former says powerful though a prince may be if he attacks a large state he will be unable to raise enough troops and must rely to some extent on external aid if he dispenses with this and with overweening confidence in his own strength simply tries to intimidate the enemy he will surely be defeated chang yu puts his view thus if we recklessly attack a large state our own people will be discontented and hang back but if as will then be the case our display of military force is inferior by half to that of the enemy the other chieftains will take fright and refuse to join us hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry nor does he foster the power of other states he carries out his own secret designs keeping his antagonists in awe the art of war by srm tzu g the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom the train of thought as said by li chfuan appears to be this secure against a combination of his enemies he can afford to reject entangling alliances and simply pursue his own secret designs his prestige enable him to dispense with external friendships thus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms this paragraph though written many years before the chun state became a serious menace is not a bad summary of the policy by which the famous six chancellors gradually paved the way for her final triumph under shih huang ti chang yu following up his previous note thinks that sun tzu is condemning this attitude of coldblooded selfishness and haughty isolation bestow rewards without regard to rule wu tzu ch less wisely says let advance be richly rewarded and retreat be heavily punished issue orders literally hang or post up without regard to previous arrangements in order to prevent treachery says wang hsi the general meaning is made clear by tsao kungs quotation from the ssuma fa give instructions only on sighting the enemy give rewards when you see deserving deeds tsao kungs paraphrase the final instructions you give to your army should not correspond with those that have been previously posted up chang yu simplifies this into your arrangements should not be divulged beforehand and chia lin says there should be no fixity in your rules and arrangements not only is there danger in letting your plans be known but war often necessitates the entire reversal of them at the last moment and you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to do with but a single man cf supra ss the art of wax by sxm tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom confront your soldiers with the deed itself never let them know your design literally do not tell them words ie do not give your reasons for any order lord mansfield once told a junior colleague to give no reasons for his decisions and the maxim is even more applicable to a general than to a judge when the outlook is bright bring it before their eyes but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy place your army in deadly peril and it will survive plunge it into desperate straits and it will come off in safety these words of sun tzu were once quoted by han hsin in explanation of the tactics he employed in one of his most brilliant battles already alluded to on p in bc he was sent against the army of chao and halted ten miles from the mouth of the chinghsing pass where the enemy had mustered in full force here at midnight he detached a body of light cavalry every man of which was furnished with a red flag their instructions were to make their way through narrow defiles and keep a secret watch on the enemy when the men of chao see me in full flight han hsin said they will abandon their fortifications and give chase this must be the sign for you to rush in pluck down the chao standards and set up the red banners of han in their stead turning then to his other officers he remarked our adversary holds a strong position and is not likely to come out and attack us until he sees the standard and drums of the commanderinchief for fear i should turn back and escape through the mountains so saying he first of all sent out a division consisting of men and ordered them to form in line of battle with their backs to the river ti seeing this maneuver the whole army of chao broke into loud laughter by this time it was broad daylight and han hsin displaying the generalissimos flag marched out of the pass with drums beating and was immediately engaged by the enemy a great battle followed lasting for some time until at length han hsin and his colleague chang ni leaving drums and banner on the field fled to the division on the river bank where another fierce battle was raging the enemy rushed out to pursue them and to secure the the art of war by srm tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom trophies thus denuding their ramparts of men but the two generals succeeded in joining the other army which was fighting with the utmost desperation the time had now come for the horsemen to play their part as soon as they saw the men of chao following up their advantage they galloped behind the deserted walls tore up the enemys flags and replaced them by those of han when the chao army looked back from the pursuit the sight of these red flags struck them with terror convinced that the hans had got in and overpowered their king they broke up in wild disorder every effort of their leader to stay the panic being in vain then the han army fell on them from both sides and completed the rout killing a number and capturing the rest amongst whom was king ya himselfafter the battle some of han hsins officers came to him and said in the art of war we are told to have a hill or tumulus on the right rear and a river or marsh on the left front this appears to be a blend of sun tzu and tai kung see ix ss and note you on the contrary ordered us to draw up our troops with the river at our back under these conditions how did you manage to gain the victory the general replied i fear you gentlemen have not studied the art of war with sufficient care is it not written there plunge your army into desperate straits and it will come off in safety place it in deadly peril and it will survive had i taken the usual course i should never have been able to bring my colleague round what says the military classic â€” swoop down on the marketplace and drive the men off to fight this passage does not occur in the present text of sun tzu if i had not placed my troops in a position where they were obliged to fight for their lives but had allowed each man to follow his own discretion there would have been a general debandade and it would have been impossible to do anything with them the officers admitted the force of his argument and said these are higher tactics than we should have been capable of see chien han shu ch ff for it is precisely when a force has fallen into harms way that is capable of striking a blow for victory danger has a bracing effect the art of war by srm tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to the enemys purpose tsao kung says feign stupidity â€” by an appearance of yielding and falling in with the enemys wishes chang yus note makes the meaning clear if the enemy shows an inclination to advance lure him on to do so if he is anxious to retreat delay on purpose that he may carry out his intention the object is to make him remiss and contemptuous before we deliver our attack by persistently hanging on the enemys flank i understand the first four words to mean accompanying the enemy in one direction tsao kung says unite the soldiers and make for the enemy but such a violent displacement of characters is quite indefensible we shall succeed in the long run literally after a thousand li in killing the commanderinchief always a great point with the chinese this is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning on the day that you take up your command block the frontier passes destroy the official tallies these were tablets of bamboo or wood one half of which was issued as a permit or passport by the official in charge of a gate cf the borderwarden of lun yu iii who may have had similar duties when this half was returned to him within a fixed period he was authorized to open the gate and let the traveler through and stop the passage of all emissaries either to or from the enemys country be stern in the councilchamber show no weakness and insist on your plans being ratified by the sovereign so that you may control the situation the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom mei yaochf en understands the whole sentence to mean take the strictest precautions to ensure secrecy in your deliberations if the enemy leaves a door open you must rush in forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear cf supra ss and subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground chf en haos explanation if i manage to seize a favorable position but the enemy does not appear on the scene the advantage thus obtained cannot be turned to any practical account he who intends therefore to occupy a position of importance to the enemy must begin by making an artful appointment so to speak with his antagonist and cajole him into going there as well mei yaochfen explains that this artful appointment is to be made through the medium of the enemys own spies who will carry back just the amount of information that we choose to give them then having cunningly disclosed our intentions we must manage though starting after the enemy to arrive before him vii ss we must start after him in order to ensure his marching thither we must arrive before him in order to capture the place without trouble taken thus the present passage lends some support to mei yaochfens interpretation of ss walk in the path defined by rule chia lin says victory is the only thing that matters and this cannot be achieved by adhering to conventional canons it is unfortunate that this variant rests on very slight authority for the sense yielded is certainly much more satisfactory napoleon as we know according to the veterans of the old school whom he defeated won his battles by violating every accepted canon of warfare and accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive battle tu mu says conform to the enemys tactics until a favorable opportunity offers then come forth and engage in a battle that shall prove decisive the an of war by son izu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom at first then exhibit the coyness of a maiden until the enemy gives you an opening afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running hare and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you as the hare is noted for its extreme timidity the comparison hardly appears felicitous but of course sun tzu was thinking only of its speed the words have been taken to mean you must flee from the enemy as quickly as an escaping hare but this is rightly rejected by tu mu giles biographical dictionary no the science of war p stonewall jackson vol i p the art of wai by sim tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom xii the attack by fire rather more than half the chapter ss is devoted to the subject of fire after which the author branches off into other topics sun tzu said there are five ways of attacking with fire the first is to burn soldiers in their camp so tu mu li chf uan says set fire to the camp and kill the soldiers when they try to escape from the flames pan chfao sent on a diplomatic mission to the king of shan shan see xi ss note found himself placed in extreme peril by the unexpected arrival of an envoy from the hsiung nu the mortal enemies of the chinese in consultation with his officers he exclaimed never venture never win the only course open to us now is to make an assault by fire on the barbarians under cover of night when they will not be able to discern our numbers profiting by their panic we shall exterminate them completely this will cool the kings courage and cover us with glory besides ensuring the success of our mission the officers all replied that it would be necessary to discuss the matter first with the intendant pan chfao then fell into a passion it is today he cried that our fortunes must be decided the intendant is only a humdrum civilian who on hearing of our project will certainly be afraid and everything will be brought to light an inglorious death is no worthy fate for valiant warriors all then agreed to do as he wished accordingly as soon as night came on he and his little band quickly made their way to the barbarian camp a strong gale was blowing at the time pan chfao ordered ten of the party to take drums and hide behind the enemys barracks it being arranged that when they saw flames shoot up they should begin drumming and yelling with all their might the rest of his men armed with bows and crossbows he posted in ambuscade at the gate of the camp he then set fire to the place from the windward side whereupon a deafening noise of drums and shouting arose on the front and rear of the hsiungnu who rushed out pellmell in frantic disorder pan chfao slew three of them with his own hand while his companions cut off the heads of the envoy and thirty of his suite the remainder more than a hundred in all perished in the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom the flames on the following day pan chfao divining his thoughts said with uplifted hand although you did not go with us last night i should not think sir of taking sole credit for our exploit this satisfied kuo hsun and pan chfao having sent for kuang king of shanshan showed him the head of the barbarian envoy the whole kingdom was seized with fear and trembling which pan chfao took steps to allay by issuing a public proclamation then taking the kings sons as hostage he returned to make his report to tou ku hou han shu ch ff the second is to burn stores tu mu says provisions fuel and fodder in order to subdue the rebellious population of kiangnan kao keng recommended wen ti of the sui dynasty to make periodical raids and burn their stores of grain a policy which in the long run proved entirely successful the third is to burn baggage trains an example given is the destruction of yuan shaos wagons and impedimenta by tsao tsao in ad the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines tu mu says that the things contained in arsenals and magazines are the same he specifies weapons and other implements bullion and clothing cf vii ss the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy tu yu says in the tung tien to drop fire into the enemys camp the method by which this may be done is to set the tips of arrows alight by dipping them into a brazier and then shoot them from powerful crossbows into the enemys lines in order to carry out an attack we must have means available tsao kung thinks that traitors in the enemys camp are referred to but chf en hao is more likely to be right in saying we must have favorable circumstances in general not merely traitors to help us chia lin says we must avail ourselves of wind and dry weather the art of war by srrn tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom the material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness tu mu suggests as material for making fire dry vegetable matter reeds brushwood straw grease oil etc here we have the material cause chang yu says vessels for hoarding fire stuff for lighting fires there is a proper season for making attacks with fire and special days for starting a conflagration the proper season is when the weather is very dry the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the sieve the wall the wing or the crossbar these are respectively the th th th and th of the twentyeight stellar mansions corresponding roughly to sagittarius pegasus crater and corvus for these four are all days of rising wind in attacking with fire one should be prepared to meet five possible developments when fire breaks out inside to enemys camp respond at once with an attack from without if there is an outbreak of fire but the enemys soldiers remain quiet bide your time and do not attack the prime object of attacking with fire is to throw the enemy into confusion if this effect is not produced it means that the enemy is ready to receive us hence the necessity for caution when the force of the flames has reached its height follow it up with an attack if that is practicable if not stay where you are tsao kung says if you see a possible way advance but if you find the difficulties too great retire the art of wai by sim izu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom if it is possible to make an assault with fire from without do not wait for it to break out within but deliver your attack at a favorable moment tu mu says that the previous paragraphs had reference to the fire breaking out either accidentally we may suppose or by the agency of incendiaries inside the enemys camp but he continues if the enemy is settled in a waste place littered with quantities of grass or if he has pitched his camp in a position which can be burnt out we must carry our fire against him at any seasonable opportunity and not await on in hopes of an outbreak occurring within for fear our opponents should themselves burn up the surrounding vegetation and thus render our own attempts fruitless the famous li ling once baffled the leader of the hsiungnu in this way the latter taking advantage of a favorable wind tried to set fire to the chinese generals camp but found that every scrap of combustible vegetation in the neighborhood had already been burnt down on the other hand pots x ai a general of the yellow turban rebels was badly defeated in ad through his neglect of this simple precaution at the head of a large army he was besieging chf angshe which was held by huangfu sung the garrison was very small and a general feeling of nervousness pervaded the ranks so huangfu sung called his officers together and said in war there are various indirect methods of attack and numbers do not count for everything the commentator here quotes sun tzu v ss and now the rebels have pitched their camp in the midst of thick grass which will easily burn when the wind blows if we set fire to it at night they will be thrown into a panic and we can make a sortie and attack them on all sides at once thus emulating the achievement of tien tan see p that same evening a strong breeze sprang up so huangfu sung instructed his soldiers to bind reeds together into torches and mount guard on the city walls after which he sent out a band of daring men who stealthily made their way through the lines and started the fire with loud shouts and yells simultaneously a glare of light shot up from the city walls and huangfu sung sounding his drums led a rapid charge which threw the rebels into confusion and put them to headlong flight hou han shu ch the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom when you start a fire be to windward of it do not attack from the leeward chang yu following tu yu says when you make a fire the enemy will retreat away from it if you oppose his retreat and attack him then he will fight desperately which will not conduce to your success a rather more obvious explanation is given by tu mu if the wind is in the east begin burning to the east of the enemy and follow up the attack yourself from that side if you start the fire on the east side and then attack from the west you will suffer in the same way as your enemy a wind that rises in the daytime lasts long but a night breeze soon falls cf lao tzus saying a violent wind does not last the space of a morning tao te ching chap mei yao chfen and wang hsi say a day breeze dies down at nightfall and a night breeze at daybreak this is what happens as a general rule the phenomenon observed may be correct enough but how this sense is to be obtained is not apparent in every army the five developments connected with fire must be known the movements of the stars calculated and a watch kept for the proper days tu mu says we must make calculations as to the paths of the stars and watch for the days on which wind will rise before making our attack with fire chang yu seems to interpret the text differently we must not only know how to assail our opponents with fire but also be on our guard against similar attacks from them hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength by means of water an enemy may be intercepted but not robbed of all his belongings tsao kungs note is we can merely obstruct the enemys road or divide his army but not sweep away all his accumulated stores water can do useful service but it the art of wai by sim izu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom lacks the terrible destructive power of fire this is the reason chang yu concludes why the former is dismissed in a couple of sentences whereas the attack by fire is discussed in detail wu tzu ch speaks thus of the two elements if an army is encamped on lowlying marshy ground from which the water cannot run off and where the rainfall is heavy it may be submerged by a flood if an army is encamped in wild marsh lands thickly overgrown with weeds and brambles and visited by frequent gales it may be exterminated by fire unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise for the result is waste of time and general stagnation this is one of the most perplexing passages in sun tzu tsao kung says rewards for good service should not be deferred a single day and tu mu if you do not take opportunity to advance and reward the deserving your subordinates will not carry out your commands and disaster will ensue for several reasons however and in spite of the formidable array of scholars on the other side i prefer the interpretation suggested by mei yaochfen alone whose words i will quote those who want to make sure of succeeding in their battles and assaults must seize the favorable moments when they come and not shrink on occasion from heroic measures that is to say they must resort to such means of attack of fire water and the like what they must not do and what will prove fatal is to sit still and simply hold to the advantages they have got hence the saying the enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead the good general cultivates his resources tu mu quotes the following from the san lueh ch the warlike prince controls his soldiers by his authority kits them together by good faith and by rewards makes them serviceable if faith decays there will be disruption if rewards are deficient commands will not be respected the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom move not unless you see an advantage use not your troops unless there is something to be gained fight not unless the position is critical sun tzu may at times appear to be overcautious but he never goes so far in that direction as the remarkable passage in the tao te ching ch i dare not take the initiative but prefer to act on the defensive i dare not advance an inch but prefer to retreat a foot no ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen no general should fight a battle simply out of pique if it is to your advantage make a forward move if not stay where you are this is repeated from xi ss here i feel convinced that it is an interpolation for it is evident that ss ought to follow immediately on ss anger may in time change to gladness vexation may be succeeded by content but a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being the wu state was destined to be a melancholy example of this saying nor can the dead ever be brought back to life hence the enlightened ruler is heedful and the good general full of caution this is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact unless you enter the tigers lair you cannot get hold of the tigers cubs the art of war by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom xi the use of spies sun tzu said raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the resources of the state the daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver cf ii ss ss there will be commotion at home and abroad and men will drop down exhausted on the highways cf tao te ching ch where troops have been quartered brambles and thorns spring up chang yu has the note we may be reminded of the saying on serious ground gather in plunder why then should carriage and transportation cause exhaustion on the highways the answer is that not victuals alone but all sorts of munitions of war have to be conveyed to the army besides the injunction to forage on the enemy only means that when an army is deeply engaged in hostile territory scarcity of food must be provided against hence without being solely dependent on the enemy for corn we must forage in order that there may be an uninterrupted flow of supplies then again there are places like salt deserts where provisions being unobtainable supplies from home cannot be dispensed with as many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their labor mei yaochf en says men will be lacking at the plough tail the allusion is to the system of dividing land into nine parts each consisting of about acres the plot in the center being cultivated on behalf of the state by the tenants of the other eight it was here also so tu mu tells us that their cottages were built and a well sunk to be used by all in common see ii ss note in time of war one of the families had to serve in the army while the other seven contributed to its support thus by a levy of men reckoning one ablebodied soldier to each family the husbandry of families would be affected the art of wax by sxm tzu iso the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom hostile armies may face each other for years striving for the victory which is decided in a single day this being so to remain in ignorance of the enemys condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments for spies is of course the meaning though it would spoil the effect of this curiously elaborate exordium if spies were actually mentioned at this point is the height of inhumanity sun tzus agreement is certainly ingenious he begins by adverting to the frightful misery and vast expenditure of blood and treasure which war always brings in its train now unless you are kept informed of the enemys condition and are ready to strike at the right moment a war may drag on for years the only way to get this information is to employ spies and it is impossible to obtain trustworthy spies unless they are properly paid for their services but it is surely false economy to grudge a comparatively trifling amount for this purpose when every day that the war lasts eats up an incalculably greater sum this grievous burden falls on the shoulders of the poor and hence sun tzu concludes that to neglect the use of spies is nothing less than a crime against humanity one who acts thus is no leader of men no present help to his sovereign no master of victory this idea that the true object of war is peace has its root in the national temperament of the chinese even so far back as bc these memorable words were uttered by prince chuang of the chf u state the chinese character for prowess is made up of the characters for to stay and a spear cessation of hostilities military prowess is seen in the repression of cruelty the calling in of weapons the preservation of the appointment of heaven the firm establishment of merit the bestowal of happiness on the people putting harmony between the princes the diffusion of wealth the art of wai by sim tzu s the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom thus what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men is foreknowledge that is knowledge of the enemys dispositions and what he means to do now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits it cannot be obtained inductively from experience tu mus note is knowledge of the enemy cannot be gained by reasoning from other analogous cases nor by any deductive calculation li chfuan says quantities like length breadth distance and magnitude are susceptible of exact mathematical determination human actions cannot be so calculated knowledge of the enemys dispositions can only be obtained from other men mei yaochfen has rather an interesting note knowledge of the spiritworld is to be obtained by divination information in natural science may be sought by inductive reasoning the laws of the universe can be verified by mathematical calculation but the dispositions of an enemy are ascertainable through spies and spies alone hence the use of spies of whom there are five classes local spies inward spies converted spies doomed spies surviving spies when these five kinds of spy are all at work none can discover the secret system this is called divine manipulation of the threads it is the sovereigns most precious faculty cromwell one of the greatest and most practical of all cavalry leaders had officers styled scout masters whose business it was to collect all possible information regarding the enemy through scouts and spies etc and much of his the art of wai by sim izu s the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom success in war was traceable to the previous knowledge of the enemys moves thus gained having local spies means employing the services of the inhabitants of a district tu mu says in the enemys country win people over by kind treatment and use them as spies having inward spies making use of officials of the enemy tu mu enumerates the following classes as likely to do good service in this respect worthy men who have been degraded from office criminals who have undergone punishment also favorite concubines who are greedy for gold men who are aggrieved at being in subordinate positions or who have been passed over in the distribution of posts others who are anxious that their side should be defeated in order that they may have a chance of displaying their ability and talents fickle turncoats who always want to have a foot in each boat officials of these several kinds he continues should be secretly approached and bound to ones interests by means of rich presents in this way you will be able to find out the state of affairs in the enemys country ascertain the plans that are being formed against you and moreover disturb the harmony and create a breach between the sovereign and his ministers the necessity for extreme caution however in dealing with inward spies appears from an historical incident related by ho shih lo shang governor of lchou sent his general wei po to attack the rebel li hsiung of shu in his stronghold at p x i after each side had experienced a number of victories and defeats li hsiung had recourse to the services of a certain pofai a native of wutu he began to have him whipped until the blood came and then sent him off to lo shang whom he was to delude by offering to cooperate with him from inside the city and to give a fire signal at the right moment for making a general assault lo shang confiding in these promises march out all his best troops and placed wei po and others at their head with orders to attack at p x o fais bidding meanwhile li hsiungs general li hsiang had prepared an ambuscade on their line of march and p x o f ai having reared long scalingladders against the city the art of wax by sxm tzn s the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom walls now lighted the beaconfire wei pos men raced up on seeing the signal and began climbing the ladders as fast as they could while others were drawn up by ropes lowered from above more than a hundred of lo shangs soldiers entered the city in this way every one of whom was forthwith beheaded li hsiung then charged with all his forces both inside and outside the city and routed the enemy completely this happened in ad i do not know where ho shih got the story from it is not given in the biography of li hsiung or that of his father li fe chin shu ch having converted spies getting hold of the enemys spies and using them for our own purposes by means of heavy bribes and liberal promises detaching them from the enemys service and inducing them to carry back false information as well as to spy in turn on their own countrymen on the other hand hsiao shihhsien says that we pretend not to have detected him but contrive to let him carry away a false impression of what is going on several of the commentators accept this as an alternative definition but that it is not what sun tzu meant is conclusively proved by his subsequent remarks about treating the converted spy generously ss sqq ho shih notes three occasions on which converted spies were used with conspicuous success by tien tan in his defense of chimo see supra p by chao she on his march to oyu see p and by the wily fan chu in bc when lien p x o was conducting a defensive campaign against chun the king of chao strongly disapproved of lien pos cautious and dilatory methods which had been unable to avert a series of minor disasters and therefore lent a ready ear to the reports of his spies who had secretly gone over to the enemy and were already in fan chus pay they said the only thing which causes chun anxiety is lest chao kua should be made general lien p x o they consider an easy opponent who is sure to be vanquished in the long run now this chao kua was a sun of the famous chao she from his boyhood he had been wholly engrossed in the study of war and military matters until at last he came to believe that there was no commander in the whole empire who could stand against him his father was much disquieted by this overweening conceit and the flippancy the ait of wai by sim tzu s the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom with which he spoke of such a serious thing as war and solemnly declared that if ever kua was appointed general he would bring ruin on the armies of chao this was the man who in spite of earnest protests from his own mother and the veteran statesman lin hsiangju was now sent to succeed lien p x o needless to say he proved no match for the redoubtable po chfi and the great military power of chun he fell into a trap by which his army was divided into two and his communications cut and after a desperate resistance lasting days during which the famished soldiers devoured one another he was himself killed by an arrow and his whole force amounting it is said to men ruthlessly put to the sword having doomed spies doing certain things openly for purposes of deception and allowing our spies to know of them and report them to the enemy tu yu gives the best exposition of the meaning we ostentatiously do thing calculated to deceive our own spies who must be led to believe that they have been unwittingly disclosed then when these spies are captured in the enemys lines they will make an entirely false report and the enemy will take measures accordingly only to find that we do something quite different the spies will thereupon be put to death as an example of doomed spies ho shih mentions the prisoners released by pan chf ao in his campaign against yarkand see p he also refers to tang chien who in ad was sent by t x ai tsung to lull the turkish kahn chiehli into fancied security until li ching was able to deliver a crushing blow against him chang yu says that the turks revenged themselves by killing tang chien but this is a mistake for we read in both the old and the new tang history ch fol and ch fol respectively that he escaped and lived on until li lchi played a somewhat similar part in bc when sent by the king of han to open peaceful negotiations with chfi he has certainly more claim to be described a doomed spy for the king of chfi being subsequently attacked without warning by han hsin and infuriated by what he considered the treachery of li lchi ordered the unfortunate envoy to be boiled alive the art of war by sim izu ss the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom surviving spies finally are those who bring back news from the enemys camp this is the ordinary class of spies properly so called forming a regular part of the army tu mu says your surviving spy must be a man of keen intellect though in outward appearance a fool of shabby exterior but with a will of iron he must be active robust endowed with physical strength and courage thoroughly accustomed to all sorts of dirty work able to endure hunger and cold and to put up with shame and ignominy ho shih tells the following story of tahsi wu of the sui dynasty when he was governor of eastern chun shenwu of chfi made a hostile movement upon shayuan the emperor tai tsu kao tsu sent ta hsi wu to spy upon the enemy he was accompanied by two other men all three were on horseback and wore the enemys uniform when it was dark they dismounted a few hundred feet away from the enemys camp and stealthily crept up to listen until they succeeded in catching the passwords used in the army then they got on their horses again and boldly passed through the camp under the guise of nightwatchmen and more than once happening to come across a soldier who was committing some breach of discipline they actually stopped to give the culprit a sound cudgeling thus they managed to return with the fullest possible information about the enemys dispositions and received warm commendation from the emperor who in consequence of their report was able to inflict a severe defeat on his adversary hence it is that which none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies tu mu and mei yaochf en point out that the spy is privileged to enter even the generals private sleepingtent none should be more liberally rewarded in no other business should greater secrecy be preserved tu mu gives a graphic touch all communication with spies should be carried mouthtoear the following remarks on spies may be quoted from turenne who made perhaps larger use of them than any previous commander the art of wax by sxm tzn the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom spies are attached to those who give them most he who pays them ill is never served they should never be known to anybody nor should they know one another when they propose anything very material secure their persons or have in your possession their wives and children as hostages for their fidelity never communicate anything to them but what is absolutely necessary that they should know spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity mei yaochfen says in order to use them one must know fact from falsehood and be able to discriminate between honesty and doubledealing wang hsi in a different interpretation thinks more along the lines of intuitive perception and practical intelligence tu mu strangely refers these attributes to the spies themselves before using spies we must assure ourselves as to their integrity of character and the extent of their experience and skill but he continues a brazen face and a crafty disposition are more dangerous than mountains or rivers it takes a man of genius to penetrate such so that we are left in some doubt as to his real opinion on the passage they cannot be properly managed without benevolence and straightforwardness chang yu says when you have attracted them by substantial offers you must treat them with absolute sincerity then they will work for you with all their might without subtle ingenuity of mind one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports mei yaochfen says be on your guard against the possibility of spies going over to the service of the enemy be subtle be subtle and use your spies for every kind of business cf vi ss if a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told the art of wai by sim izu s the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom word for word the translation here is if spy matters are heard before our plans are carried out etc sun tzus main point in this passage is whereas you kill the spy himself as a punishment for letting out the secret the object of killing the other man is only as chfen hao puts it to stop his mouth and prevent news leaking any further if it had already been repeated to others this object would not be gained either way sun tzu lays himself open to the charge of inhumanity though tu mu tries to defend him by saying that the man deserves to be put to death for the spy would certainly not have told the secret unless the other had been at pains to worm it out of him whether the object be to crush an army to storm a city or to assassinate an individual it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants the aidesdecamp literally visitors is equivalent as tu yu says to those whose duty it is to keep the general supplied with information which naturally necessitates frequent interviews with him and doorkeepers and sentries of the general in command our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these as the first step no doubt towards finding out if any of these important functionaries can be won over by bribery the enemys spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out tempted with bribes led away and comfortably housed thus they will become converted spies and available for our service it is through the information brought by the converted spy that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward spies tu yu says through conversion of the enemys spies we learn the enemys condition and chang yu says we must tempt the converted spy into our service because it is he that knows which of the local inhabitants are greedy of gain and which of the officials are open to corruption the art of wax by sxm tzu s the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom it is owing to his information again that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy chang yu says because the converted spy knows how the enemy can best be deceived lastly it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used on appointed occasions the end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the enemy and this knowledge can only be derived in the first instance from the converted spy as explained in ss he not only brings information himself but makes it possible to use the other kinds of spy to advantage hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost liberality of old the rise of the yin dynasty sun tzu means the shang dynasty founded in bc its name was changed to yin by pan keng in was due to i chih better known as i yin the famous general and statesman who took part in chfeng tangs campaign against chieh kuei who had served under the hsia likewise the rise of the chou dynasty was due to lu ya lu shang rose to high office under the tyrant chou hsin whom he afterwards helped to overthrow popularly known as tai kung a title bestowed on him by wen wang he is said to have composed a treatise on war erroneously identified with the liu t ao who had served under the yin there is less precision in the chinese than i have thought it well to introduce into my translation and the commentaries on the passage are by no means explicit but having regard to the context we can hardly doubt that sun the art of wax by sun tzu the puppet press wwwpuppetpresscom tzu is holding up i chin and lu ya as illustrious examples of the converted spy or something closely analogous his suggestion is that the hsia and yin dynasties were upset owing to the intimate knowledge of their weaknesses and shortcoming which these former ministers were able to impart to the other side mei yaochfen appears to resent any such aspersion on these historic names i yin and lu ya he says were not rebels against the government hsia could not employ the former hence yin employed him yin could not employ the latter hence hou employed him their great achievements were all for the good of the people ho shih is also indignant how should two divinely inspired men such as i and lu have acted as common spies sun tzus mention of them simply means that the proper use of the five classes of spies is a matter which requires men of the highest mental caliber like i and lu whose wisdom and capacity qualified them for the task the above words only emphasize this point ho shih believes then that the two heroes are mentioned on account of their supposed skill in the use of spies but this is very weak hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results tu mu closes with a note of warning just as water which carries a boat from bank to bank may also be the means of sinking it so reliance on spies while production of great results is ofttimes the cause of utter destruction spies are a most important element in water because on them depends an armys ability to move chia lin says that an army without spies is like a man with ears or eyes aids to scouting p marshal turenne p the art of war by srm tzu
